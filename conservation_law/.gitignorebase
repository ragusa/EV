# NOTE: .gitignore should NOT be modified; modify .gitignorebase instead.
#
# The file .gitignorebase is used as a base for the actual .gitignore file;
# whenever the ./bin/make_symlinks script is run to create symbolic links,
# the .gitignorebase file is copied to .gitignore and then symbolic links
# are appended afterward. For this reason, .gitignorebase should be the
# file to modify if any additional files need to be added to the list.
