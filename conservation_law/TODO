The following is a list of things to do:

1. Replace cell maps with cell vectors - cell quantities shall be stored in a
   vector indexed by cell index instead of cell iterator. To get the
   corresponding cell iterator, one can store a vector indexed by cell index
   to cell iterators.
2. Remove unnecessary "auto" usage.
3. Instead of using MatrixTools to modify linear systems for Dirichlet boundary
   conditions, implement Dirichlet BC with the constraint matrix. The difficulty
   with this is that the transient system matrix is possibly composed of several
   matrices, say A and B. To impose Dirichlet BC on matrices A and B separately
   using the constraint matrix and then combine them does not yield the correct
   modification for Dirichlet BC on the matrix A+B. One needs to take care
   in doing this.
4. Remove the assumption of the DoF ordering.
5. More documentation.
6. Implement parallelization.
7. Make sure there are no Assert statements in a one-line "if" statement - for
   release mode, the statement following the conditional branch would then be
   used as the else statement - curly brackets need to surround the Assert
   statement.
8. Move ShallowWaterFCT.cc to src folder and add it with git.
9. Fix all of the problem parameters input files.
10. Remove unnecessary header files/add include statements for header files
    where needed; while executables may compile, classes may in future
    be used in other executables where dependencies are not resolved by
    previous includes.
11. Untemplate classes that do need the <dim> parameter.
12. Replace "throw SomeException()" with "AssertThrow(false, SomeException())"
