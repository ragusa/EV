README for transport
====================
Main source file: transport.cc
To compile program:
1. run cmake, for example "cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/bin/deal.II ."
2. run make

To run program:
$ transport <#>
where <#> is a number corresponding to a coded test problem, 1-4

Input files are located in /input and are named according to the
test problem: test_problem_#.in
