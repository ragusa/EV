Neutron transport using deal.II, post-processing
================================================

PYTHON SCRIPTS:
---------------

postprocessing.py  reads the output files in ../output to compute mean, std, and N for
                   each experiment; results are then stored in results.out
speedup.py         reads results.out and creates speedup plot data
strong.py          reads results.out and creates strong scaling plot data
timing.py          reads results.out and creates timing plots data

GNUPLOT SCRIPTS:
----------------

speedup.gp            speedup plot data
strong.gp             strong scaling plot data
timing_initialize.gp  timing plot data, initialize section
timing_setup.gp       timing plot data, setup section
timing_assemble.gp    timing plot data, assemble section
timing_solve.gp       timing plot data, solve section
timing_output.gp      timing plot data, output section

OTHER FILES:
------------

*.gpl        Gnuplot plot data
*.pdf        plots
results.out  processed data
