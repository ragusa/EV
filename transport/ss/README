Neutron transport using deal.II
===============================

SOURCE FILES:
-------------

transport_parallel.cc        Main file, parallel version
transport_serial.cc          Main file, serial version
TransportParameters.h
TransportParameters.cc
TransportProblemParallel.h
TransportProblemParallel.cc

OTHER FILES:
-------------

input_r##       input file for refinement level ##
CMakeLists.txt  cmake file to create Makefile
*.vtu, *.pvtu   output files, can be loaded using visit

PYTHON SCRIPTS:
---------------

njobs.py    shows how many of your jobs are currently in queue
summary.py  shows which runs have been made, and how many
run.py      submits a single job
runmult.py  submits multiple of the same job

COMPILING:
----------

Note that deal.II must be installed with options of interfaces
with PETSc and p4est. Path to deal.II installation is stored
in environment variable $DEAL_II_DIR.

1. Run cmake:
   $> cmake .
2. Set mode, either "debug":
   $> make debug
   or "release":
   $> make release
3. Run make:
   $> make

RUNNING:
--------

To run the serial program transport_serial:

$> transport_serial <input_file>

where input_file is the name of the input file to be used.
To run the parallel program transport_parallel:

$> mpirun -np <n_proc> transport_parallel <input_file>

where n_proc is the number of processors.
