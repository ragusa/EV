\title{A Positivity-Preserving Flux Corrected Transport Scheme for Solving
Scalar Conservation Law Problems Using the Continuous Finite Element Method}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

In this presentation, a positivity-preserving scheme for solving scalar
conservation law problems using the continuous finite element method
is presented. This scheme is based on the flux-corrected transport (FCT)
algorithm originally developed by Boris and Book and the entropy viscosity
method developed by Guermond. This scheme is 2nd-order accurate,
guaranteed positivity-preserving, effectively eliminates spurious
oscillations, satisfies a dicrete maximum principle, and is valid
for any mesh in any number of dimensions. In-depth topics will include
the justification of the monotone low-order scheme, a discussion on the
ideas of entropy viscosity, and derivation of the limiting coefficients
used by the FCT algorithm. The majority of the presentation will
discuss explicit time discretizations and linear conservation laws,
but scheme differences for implicit time discretizations and nonlinear
conservation laws are given. Results shown will include 1-D and multi-dimensional
results for linear transport conservation law problems.
