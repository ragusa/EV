	Scale (GADS) were the most frequently used measures. Among the less

	the use of a very narrow range of ASD-specific instruments. Concerns
	are raised regarding the inconsistent inclusion of developmental
	questionnaires, parent/guardian interviews, and medical professionals
	in the ASD evaluation process. Implications for practice and the

  abstract = {All-too-often, well-meaning individuals urge parents to seek referrals
	for psychological evaluation without considering or understanding
	the typical characteristics of gifted children or the impact of intellectual
	ability on behavior and relationships. In turn, clinicians receiving
	such referrals also may fail to assess the implications of giftedness

	the literature on Asperger's Disorder is replete with many references
	to high ability/giftedness and Asperger's Disorder, there is, at
	this time, only one instrument that delineates giftedness and characteristics
	of Asperger's Disorder. Burger-Veltmeijer (2008) of the Netherlands
	created the Dimensional Discrepancy Model GFT + ASD (DD-Checklist)
	to help psychologists observe the characteristics of gifted-like
	manifestations versus Asperger's Disorder-like manifestations. This
	article presents the Giftedness/Asperger's Disorder Checklist (GADC)
	which was similarly developed to help educators, mental health professionals,
	and parents during the prereferral process to see if environmental
	interventions would be beneficial in the process of determining the
	need for more formal diagnostic evaluation. Like the DD-Checklist,
	the GADC focuses on the educational and psychological needs of the
	student who may or may not be gifted and who may or may not have
	Asperger's Disorder. The author discusses how to use the GADC and
	describes two principles that should be followed to determine accurate
	differentiation. (Contains 1 table.)},

  abstract = {The methods used by the General Educational Development Testing Service
	(GEDTS) to establish and maintain score stability and reading reliability
	on its direct assessment of writing are described. Using the 1988
	site certification and monitoring results of several scoring sites,
	the focus is on describing how the score scale was established and
	how reader training and certification, scoring site certification,
	and scoring monitoring procedures were developed and implemented.
	The Tests of General Educational Development (GED) are used extensively
	to award high school equivalency diplomas. A writing essay was added
	in the 1988 administration. The nature of the tests required that
	essays be scored in decentralized scoring sessions. Holistic scoring
	with two readers was chosen, with a third reading if scores differed
	too much. The GED direct assessment is norm-referenced, calling for
	a descriptive, rather than prescriptive, scoring guide. Chief readers
	and readers receive training in scoring, and a site is only certified
	when readers have been trained. Systematic monitoring reduces or
	eliminates scoring drift. Approximately 150 persons attended the
	first Chief Reader training. At the end of the first year of site
	certification, 52 operational scoring sites were established. Monitoring
	results of 15 sites are presented. Ensuring fair and stable scoring
	from site to site requires careful planning and systematic procedures.
	The process so far illustrates the importance of training readers
	and monitoring the sites. Seven tables present monitoring results.
	Nine appendices provide additional information about the development
	process, including scoring, test instructions, and reader requirements.

	and (3) the usefulness of the GED program in preparing students for

	9.30% were unemployed; and 20.93% were in college. Of the employed

  __markedentry = {[wendy]},
  abstract = {With online education continuing its meteoric rise, some educators
	continue to debate the efficacy of the medium--in particular, the
	ability to discuss complex subjects online. However, the online asynchronous
	discussion environment seems to offer some advantages over the traditional
	classroom including increased time for students to research and reflect
	on ideas and physical anonymity that may decrease inhibitions and
	foster broad participation. This article examines the theoretical
	advantages of online discussion groups and the survey results from
	122 experienced faculty members to determine, first, how many faculty
	members prefer the online environment and, second, what is the relationship
	of this preference to their assessment of the superiority of online
	discussion. The results indicate that half of the faculty who teach
	online and on-ground prefer teaching in both environments and that
	three quarters of those educators believe the online environment
	facilitates more substantive discussion. As online education continues
	to explode, the implications for educators include the need to understand
	and embrace the inherent online classroom advantages and how to integrate
	those advantages with traditional classrooms including hybrid (on-ground/online)
	models. Educators failing to do this will find themselves left behind
	in the fastest-growing education segment and potentially less effective
	in the traditional classroom where younger students have come to
	increasingly rely on interactive/asynchronous communication as a
	preferred method of communication. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright

	as, "The essential features of Asperger's Disorder are severe and
	sustained impairment in social interaction and development of restricted
	repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, and activities. This
	disturbance must cause clinically significant impairment in social,
	occupational, or other important areas of functioning. In contrast
	to Autistic Disorder, there are no clinically significant delays
	or deviance in language acquisition (e.g., single non-echoed words
	are communicatively by age 2 years, and spontaneous communicative
	phrases are used by age 3 years), although more subtle aspects of
	social communication (e.g., typical give-and-take in conversation
	may be affected." (p. 80). Since social interaction presents a challenge
	to Asperger children, the teacher needs to create a positive classroom
	environment utilizing a social behavioral curriculum. A positive
	classroom environment gives the Asperger student a sense of well-being.},

	new multi-component social skills intervention for children with
	Asperger syndrome (AS): The Junior Detective Training Program. This
	7-week program included a computer game, small group sessions, parent
	training sessions and teacher handouts. Method: Forty-nine children
	with AS were recruited to participate and randomly assigned to intervention
	(n = 26) or wait-list control (n = 23) conditions. Results: Relative
	to children in the wait-list group, program participants showed greater
	improvements in social skills over the course of the intervention,
	as indicated by parent-report measures. Teacher-report data also
	confirmed that children receiving the intervention made significant
	improvements in social functioning from pre- to post-treatment. Treatment
	group participants were better able to suggest appropriate emotion-management
	strategies for story characters at post-intervention than at pre-intervention,
	whereas control participants were not. However, there was no difference
	in the improvements made by children in the intervention and control
	conditions on facial expression and body-posture recognition measures.
	Follow-up data suggested that treatment gains were maintained by
	children at 5-months post-intervention. Conclusions: The Junior Detective
	Training Program appeared to be effective in enhancing the social
	skills and emotional understanding of children with AS. Limitations
	and suggestions for future research are discussed. Reprinted by permission

	examined included age, gender, highest level of education achieved

	GED tests, current occupation, successful diploma achievement, and
	opinions about postsecondary education. Examinees were also asked
	about the granting of academic credit for extrainstitutional learning

	percentage of enrollments was in community or junior colleges, the
	smallest in four-year colleges or universities. Trade schools, technical
	schools, and apprenticeship programs had similar enrollment percentages.
	There were fewer enrollments reported in programs that awarded academic
	credit for extrainstitutional learning. Examinees in the late-30s
	age group had a high percentage of enrollments in technical schools
	and apprenticeship programs. There was a higher percentage of women
	in four-year colleges or universities. Nonenrollees varied from enrollees
	on opinion statements dealing with the ease of admission to postsecondary
	programs and the concept of universal postsecondary education. The
	concept of academic credit for extrainstitutional learning was positively
	received, as was the idea of postsecondary information centers associated
	with GED testing centers. The survey instrument is appended. (Author/KC)},

	of Israeli Teachers Working with Palestinian Prisoners This paper
	explores a unique and controversial case of Israeli English-language

	around Israel for involvement in terrorist activity against Israelis.
	This phenomenon is profoundly complex as the prisoners in question
	have been convicted of terrorist crimes against Israeli soldiers
	and civilians. The teachers who enter the prisons to teach these
	inmates therefore in effect belong to the group targeted in the terrorist
	activity. This paper explores the Israeli teachers 'perceptions of
	the inmates, the teachers' perceptions of the value of education
	for these prisoners and how these perceptions influence their decisions
	to go in to the prisons to assist these students with their academic
	studies. Beyond offering an understanding of the interplay between
	political confrontation and prison education in Israel, this paper
	opens up a discussion surrounding the increasingly relevant issue
	of prison education of Islamic terrorists worldwide and raises a

  abstract = {The General Educational Development (GED) Tests date from 1942, when
	the United States Armed Forces Institute designed a battery of tests
	to provide military personnel and veterans the opportunity to obtain
	a credential that demonstrated proficiency on par with high school
	graduates. Since World War II, the GED Tests have also been beneficial
	to civilian high school noncompleters. The majority of employers
	and educational institutions accept the GED as an equivalent of the
	high school diploma, but some question its legitimacy. The military
	has stopped treating the GED as the equivalent of a high school diploma,
	since GED graduates do not perform on the Armed Forces Qualifying
	Test as well as and have a higher dropout rate from military programs
	than traditional high school graduates. The 2002-series GED Tests
	reflect the impact of welfare-to-work legislation and increased emphasis
	on academic standards in the K-12 community. Due to the recent trend
	of "adolescentization" the GED has become an alternative to completing
	a traditional high school education for many teenage students. The
	GED Testing Service and state departments of education should strongly
	consider raising the minimum age to be eligible to take GED Tests
	to 18. Educators must strive to prevent students from leaving traditional
	high school programs to take GED Tests under the misconception that
	a GED credential is easier to gain. (YLB)},

  __markedentry = {[wendy]},
  abstract = {Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) includes symptoms that
	vary in severity and frequency between children. Consequently, multiple
	psychometric assessment procedures are recommended to detect an ASD,
	including scales which asses the presence and nature of ASD-related
	behaviour. However, to date, few studies have examined the relative
	and specific contribution which such behaviourally oriented scales
	can make to the diagnosis of individual children with ASD. Method:
	Cluster analysis was used to explore the common characteristics of
	a group of 53 preschool and elementary school children with an ASD,
	based upon scores on tests of cognitive ability, adaptive behaviour
	and behavioural checklists designed to measure the presence of typical
	ASD. Results: Data confirmed the expected variability in intelligence
	test scores. In addition, measures of adaptive behaviour and data
	from a behaviourally based rating scale suggested that children with
	Asperger's Disorder and autism might be reclassified into subgroups
	according to the presence of particular ASD-specific behaviours.
	Conclusions: As well as confirming that children with ASD vary in
	their adaptive behaviour and cognitive levels, these data emphasise
	the limited contribution such assessment procedures make to an understanding
	of the child's day-to-day behaviour and functioning, thus arguing
	for the inclusion of behaviourally based rating scales to develop
	ideographic intervention plans.},

	enrolled in postsecondary education tend to converge over time, high
	school graduates are much more likely to complete their postsecondary
	education than GED recipients are. In controlled comparisons, a GED
	had little effect on labor force participation or unemployment but
	was positively associated with gains in full-time employment. Studies
	have shown that GED recipients earn more than other dropouts but
	less than high school graduates. Although GED recipients had no earnings

	Compared with high school graduates, GED recipients earn less, experience

	of the ITED (Iowa Tests of Educational Development) in preparing
	adult basic education students to take the GED tests. The first proposition,
	that the ITED can be a useful practice test for GED candidates, is
	supported by the fact that the ITED tests are designed to measure
	the same skills as the GED and that the philosophy, objectives, subtest
	titles, and formats are similar in the two tests. Proposition 2,
	that performance on the ITED correlates positively with performance
	on the GED, and therefore can be used to predict scores on the GED,
	is supported by a series of investigations which demonstrated that
	the ITED Reading Comprehension test scores can be used to predict
	(with 75 percent confidence and within five points) an individual's
	average score on the GED in science, social studies, and literature.
	Proposition 3, that various criteria levels of GED performance are
	identifiable for various student goals, is demonstrated by the construction
	of two grids, one an item analysis and the other an individual profile
	sheet, which together can help students and instructors graphically
	analyze individual students' needs to attain skill levels meeting
	their chosen criteria levels. (Author/JR)},

  abstract = {The General Educational Development (GED) testing program has been
	a part of the Alberta High School Equivalency Program since 1981.
	Between December 1981 and December 1983, 4,333 applicants passed
	the GED in Alberta, and 802 applicants failed to pass the test. Random
	samples of 200 individuals from each of these groups were studied
	to determine whether there are any consistent differences between
	members of the two groups. Usable questionnaires were returned by
	46 percent of the GED-fail group and 67 percent of the GED-pass group.
	The characteristics of the Alberta GED student population were found
	to be quite similar to those of other equivalency program student
	populations. The older students tended to seek a GED certificate
	because they deemed it personally rewarding, whereas younger enrollees
	generally saw the GED as a way of gaining a better job. Those in
	the GED-fail group were likely to be younger, have lower levels of
	formal education, and be unemployed than were their counterparts
	in the GED-pass group. A second part of the study assessed the acceptance
	of the GED by Alberta postsecondary institutions. This was accomplished
	by a survey of registrars from 19 Alberta universities, colleges,
	and technical institutes. Evidence from the survey suggests that
	while the GED program has benefited a small number of persons who
	have participated in it, the magnitude of the benefit is difficult
	to ascertain. There was, however, some indication that additional
	program participants may benefit in the future as a number of postsecondary
	institutions seemed interested in establishing policies concerning
	the Alberta GED program. (MN)},

	the development of a predictive instrument. A cloze test, which took

	148 subjects upon their completion of the GED. Results indicated

	The cloze test was most highly related to, in descending order, the

	for urban audiences when such instruction is offered at no cost to
	the student. (2) Forty percent of the audience tested stated that
	they would not have been able to prepare for the GED test in other

	would not access conventional instructional programs. (3) Major motivational
	factors included convenience of the weekend broadcast, preference

	are significant differences on age, gender, highest grade completed,
	and race. Performance on the test is significantly related to: highest
	grade completed, grades while in school, reason for taking the GED
	test, race, and reason for leaving school. Test scores are not significantly
	related to age and gender. In addition to the 71 percent who passed
	the test initially, another 15 percent did so in the subsequent 18
	months. About half of the sample indicated that the test helped them
	qualify for a job. Nearly half the group either are students or have

  abstract = {The General Educational Development (GED) testing program is frequently
	used to earn a high school diploma, since about 14 percent of diplomas
	issued in this country during 1981 were based on the GED tests. A
	study was conducted to assess the impact that passing the GED tests
	has on adults' employment and participation in educational activities.
	During April and May of 1980, the GED Testing Service collected data
	on a nationally representative sample of 12,646 GED candidates. Approximately
	75 percent of this sample agreed to participate in a follow-up study.
	In October 1981, a 20 percent random sample of this group (N=1906)
	were surveyed with a response rate of 24 percent (N=458). Results
	indicated that 71 percent of the respondents passed the test in April
	or May of 1980 with an additional 15 percent passing during the 18
	months prior to the follow-up survey. The GED candidates were extremely
	positive about their GED experience, since 95 percent would probably
	take the tests again if they were starting over. More people expected
	the GED to help them achieve a new job (75 percent) than improve
	their situation (e.g., salary increase) in their current job (about
	30 percent). In fact, the GED credential was more helpful to these
	people in obtaining a new job (52 percent) than in improving their
	situation in their current job (about 20 percent). More people expected
	the GED credential to help in attaining admittance to educational
	institutions (51 percent) than to on-the-job training (24 percent).
	During the 18 months following the initial survey, 45 percent of
	the respondents were students in some type of educational program.
	More than 75 percent plan to attend an educational program in the
	future. The survey instrument is appended. (Author/KC)},

	I explored the emerging reading identities of 10 adults who were

	paper draws on interview data to examine how one group of adults
	positioned themselves relative to official and unofficial cultural
	models of literacy. When referring to official cultural models of
	literacy, the adult students spoke extensively about the challenges
	they faced in reading words, remembering what they had read, and
	increasing their reading levels; they simultaneously described themselves
	as competent and enthusiastic readers when accessing personal models
	of reading that reflected their reading and writing practices outside
	of school. This study revealed tensions between official and unofficial
	notions of reading competency, and results suggest that teachers
	and tutors could provide better support for their adult learners
	by paying attention to the learners' personal reading practices.},

  abstract = {Daily educators are confronted with children who self-abuse through
	self-harm behaviours, eating disorders, drug or alcohol abuse or
	observe incidents that involve social isolation, for example racial
	abuse. Educators are also aware of cases of bullying and aggression
	that reaches extremes and they witness the harm inflicted on children
	through a range of violent acts. The importance of promoting emotional
	well-being therefore is central to developing security and self-confidence.
	This requires practitioners to be aware of, and responsive to, the
	importance of personal and social well-being, encouraging children
	to understand their own feelings, beliefs and values within home,
	school and community environments. This book has developed out of
	the authors research and work as psychiatrists and psychologists,
	researchers and counsellors and was inspired by collaborative research
	for DfES on Emotional Health and Wellbeing for all in Secondary Schools.
	This book aims to share and disseminate some of this good practice.
	In this book, the authors have tried to emphasize interventions that
	are evidence based. The following chapters are included: (1.1) Introduction;
	(1.2) The Stigma of Mental Health Difficulties; (1.3) Why Should
	Schools be Involved?; (1.4) Schools in a Social Setting; (1.5) Why
	Intervene at Whole-School Level?; (1.6) Where to Start in Matching

	and well being of the children and families of military service members
	as the war in Iraq continues. Observers recognize the potential stresses
	or traumas that this population might undergo as a result of the
	military deployment or the possible injury or death of military family
	members. While such concern is welcomed, it is sometimes misplaced.
	Not infrequently, conclusions that are drawn are fraught with misunderstanding
	and bias based upon lack of understanding of the military community
	or a preconceived notion of the vulnerabilities of the population.
	This problem is compounded by the paucity of scientific study. In
	this article the authors review the strengths of military families
	as well as the unique challenges that they face. The authors also
	highlight parental deployment, parental injury and parental death
	as unique stresses to military children and families. Available and
	pertinent scientific information is reviewed. Clinical observations
	of children and families during the ongoing war in Iraq are presented.

	study aimed to explore working memory functions in early-school-age
	children with Asperger's syndrome (AS). Twelve children with AS and
	29 healthy children matched on age and IQ were recruited. Results
	showed: (a) children with AS performed better in digit and word recall
	tasks, but worse in block recall task and variant-visual-patterns
	test; (b) children with AS took longer time in most conditions of
	n-back tasks, and showed larger effects of task load. These findings
	indicated imbalance of working memory development in AS children:
	they had advantage in the phonological loop storing, but disadvantage
	in the visuospatial sketchpad storing, and partial deficit in central
	executive.},

	and visuospatial perspective taking in nineteen adults with Asperger
	syndrome (AS) and fifteen control participants with the same stimulus
	material. Stimuli depicted virtual characters surrounded by two different
	objects. Virtual characters expressed a preference for one of the
	objects indicated by facial expression, gestures or head/body orientation.
	Compared to controls, participants with AS showed significantly increased
	reaction times and decreased accuracy for mentalizing (i.e., when
	inferring the virtual characters preference from the characters nonverbal
	bodily cues). By contrast, there were no significant group differences
	in perspective taking (i.e., by mental own-body transformations).
	These findings demonstrate, first, specific deficits in AS when mental
	states have to be inferred from nonverbal social cues. Second, visuospatial
	perspective taking may not necessarily be related to social impairments
	occurring in autism spectrum disorders.},

	the effectiveness of a file box system plus self-monitoring on the
	organizational skills of four fourth and fifth grade students with

	took place in general education classrooms and consisted of teaching
	students to arrange academic materials (worksheets, note pages, study
	guides etc.) in a portable file box with hanging folders. Students
	were also taught to self-monitor their accuracy. The percentage of
	correctly filed items and the number of seconds it took students'
	to retrieve requested items were the dependent variables assessed
	across conditions. Results showed that the percentage of correctly
	filed items increased and the number of seconds required to locate
	specific items decreased with the use of the file system box. These
	findings demonstrate how a simple noninvasive and affordable classroom
	modification can improve performance of children with HFA and AS

	to provide and how to provide it, we establish three aims for this
	research: identify the presence of feedback according to the regulation
	of learning required; characterise this feedback according to content
	(i.e. the meaning of feedback); and, finally, to explore possible
	relationships between feedback and the results of the teaching and
	learning process (i.e. studentsâ€™ satisfaction and final grades).
	The results for a sample of 186 students, taking nine courses at
	the Open University of Catalonia, are discussed in the light of feedback,
	which is considered a central element in university teaching practice
	in online environments. We conclude that, in general, the presence
	of feedback is associated with improved levels of performance and
	higher levels of satisfaction with the general running of the course.

	this guide for GED instructors offers lesson plans and helps teachers

	findings on the economic impact of the GED. The original version
	of this guide was developed in 1999 and 2000 by Sara Fass and Barbara
	Garner. In 2005, a GED teacher, Eileen Barry, was asked to update
	the materials. Rather than changing the existing charts and graphs,
	she had her learners use the Internet to find more recent data, and
	compare it with the data in the materials. In doing so, she introduced
	Web research to the skills learners practice as they work through
	these materials. It is hoped that by using these materials, learners
	are better prepared to make wise decisions about their work lives
	as well as being better prepared to pass the GED. It is also hoped
	that adult basic education teachers will use these materials as the
	basis for professional development for themselves so as to better
	advise learners on career and education decisions. Following an introduction,
	this guide contains three units. Unit 1, The Labor Market, contains
	Lesson 1: What Kinds of Jobs Are Out There?; Lesson 2: What's Happening
	to the Jobs that Do Exist?; and Lesson 3: Wages. Unit 2, Pursuing

	Lesson 2: Going to College. Unit 3, What the Research Tells Us, contains:

	comparing graduating high school seniors and GED Tests examinees,
	this report provides evidence of the academic value of the GED Tests
	credential. This report also identifies several academic content
	and cognitive levels in which GED Tests examinees are likely to have
	difficulties. Performance of the three groups was compared through
	comparison of standard scores, percentile rank distributions, and
	item difficulty statistics for the tests and each of the content
	and cognitive levels measured by the GED Tests. The results should
	be useful primarily to employers and admissions officers evaluating
	applicants who have a credential based on passing the GED Tests.
	Additionally, adult education administrators and teachers should

  year = {2004},
  __markedentry = {[wendy]},
  abstract = {Current testing standards call for test developers to provide evidence
	that testing procedures and test scores, and the inferences made
	based on the test scores, show evidence of validity and are comparable
	across subpopulations (American Educational Research Association
	[AERA], American Psychological Association [APA], & National Council
	on Measurement in Education [NCME], 1999). Evidence of the comparability
	of test validity across subpopulations can be collected through examination
	of: (1) the representation of the content domain being tested; (2)
	the relationship of test performance to other variables; (3) the
	internal structure of the test; (4) the response processes of examinees;
	and (5) the consequences of test score use. This research focuses
	on examining the internal structure of the test and the response
	processes of examinees with and without accommodations of test scheduling
	(e.g., extra time or breaks) and physical setting (private room).
	In an effort to contribute to the research on the effect of test
	accommodations on test performance, the current study examines the
	comparability of academic achievement test performance across examinees
	who did not receive any test accommodation and examinees who received
	an accommodation of either (1) extended time only; (2) extended time
	and private room only; or (3) extended time, private room, and supervised
	breaks only. These test accommodations represent situations in which
	there is a change in the scheduling/timing or physical setting of
	the exam versus the presentation (e.g., audio) or response format
	(dictated response) of the exam. The equivalence of an academic achievement
	test's psychometric properties across accommodated and non-accommodated
	examinees will be examined through the calculation of group descriptive
	statistics, reliability estimates, standard errors of measurement,
	and differential item functioning (DIF). (Contains 20 tables.)},

  abstract = {Background: Undergraduate medical education is shifting away from
	traditional didactic methods towards a more self-directed learning
	environment. E-learning has emerged as a vital learning modality
	that allows students to apply key principles to practical scenarios
	in a truly personalised approach. Context: At the University of Alberta,
	paediatrics is taught longitudinally, with lectures distributed throughout
	the preclinical curriculum and concentrated in the 8-week paediatric
	clinical clerkship. As a result, students entering clerkship lack
	core foundational knowledge and clinical skills. Innovation: PedsCases
	( ) is a student-driven interactive website designed to achieve the
	learning outcomes identified by the competency-based paediatric curriculum.
	This open-access e-learning tool is a comprehensive peer-reviewed
	learning resource that incorporates various learning modalities.
	Material is student generated and peer reviewed by staff paediatricians
	to ensure validity, accuracy and usefulness. After 17 months, PedsCases
	contains 216 questions, 19 cases, 11 flashcard-type quizzes, 11 podcasts
	and two clinical videos, and has had 2148 unique visitors from 73
	different countries. PedsCases is one of the top five references
	returned by Internet search engines for the phrase â€˜paediatrics
	for medical studentsâ€™. Implications: PedsCases is a collaborative
	resource created for and by medical students that provides an opportunity
	for active self-directed learning while disseminating knowledge in
	an evidence-based, interactive and clinically relevant fashion. PedsCases
	encourages students to take an active role in their education and
	drive medical education initiatives in response to the evolving curriculum.
	As the focus of medical education shifts towards independent learning,
	student-led educational tools such as PedsCases have emerged as essential
	resources for students. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Clinical

	Children with Asperger's syndrome had tried significantly more drug

  abstract = {This article provides information on flame wars, angry arguments made
	by online discussion groups. The safety of distance and relative
	anonymity make these verbal battles virtually risk-free. Flaming
	is not unique to the online world or the twenty-first century. Those
	debating the U.S. Constitution more than 200 years ago attacked each
	other mercilessly in letters published in local newspapers. What
	is best about the online world is its interactivity. It can be tempting
	to respond in kind to those who say unflattering or untrue things
	about you online. But lowering oneself to the level of attackers
	is not necessarily a good idea. This applies even more so if a person
	is responding to attacks against his business or organization. On
	the other hand, because of the Internet's inherent interactivity,
	it is generally not a good idea to remain silent, which can make
	a person appear haughty or cowardly. The best approach is to try
	to establish a dialogue. If someone has blasted you or your organization,
	ask about the circumstances that led to the person's dissatisfaction;
	come across as humane. Say sorry about the situation, and offer some
	help to resolve it. Sometimes the best approach is humor. Avoid aggravating
	the antagonism. Taking the high road also means knowing when to shut
	up. Acknowledge the criticism, state your case, offer some gentle
	persuasion, and move on. Flame wars have the potential of getting
	a person in legal trouble if he says something he know is false that
	damages someone's reputation. On the other hand, online debate can
	sometimes be akin to sport, with participants engaging in ritual
	battle. But instead of name-calling and personal attacks, the weapons
	of choice should be logic, wordplay, and witty repartee. Approached
	with amused detachment, these kinds of online duels can reach the
	level of a minor art form.},

  abstract = {The author is an associate professor of animal studies at Colorado
	State University, but experienced learning difficulties in high school
	due to her place on the autism-Asperger's spectrum. She had uneven
	skills, and while algebra was impossible, she did well in courses
	in which she could use her visual-thinking and associative-thinking
	skills. Her visual thinking skills enabled her to excel at her chosen
	career of designing livestock equipment. The author describes how
	visual thinkers like her are good at hands-on work. While she finds
	mathematical word problems to be difficult, she can conceptualize
	research experiments only if she has a concrete example such as a
	weight gain and different breeds of cattle. She cannot think about
	experimental designs in the abstract. Her success in her career ensued
	not because she "overcame a math deficit," but because she developed
	her area of strength -- visualization. There are three basic thinking
	types: visual thinkers, pattern thinkers, and word specialists, and
	these thinking styles also occur in individuals with dyslexia, ADHD,
	and other learning problems. An autism researcher found that autistic
	children have difficulty making up new categories for objects. However,
	flexibility of thinking can be taught. The author expresses concern
	when courses in music, woodshop, auto mechanics, and elective classes
	are no longer offered because these are the types of courses in which
	many students with uneven skills will excel and make themselves employable
	in good jobs. One size does not fit all, and different people have
	different types of thinking. The really good teachers try different
	methods and use the one that works for a particular child.},

	sample of employers throughout Florida to elicit their perceptions
	about the performance of GED and traditional high school graduates

	in the state, representing a variety of business types and sizes,
	returned the surveys. The results of the study indicated that in
	the areas of performance, retention, and dismissal, a majority of
	employers surveyed believe that individuals with the GED diploma
	can function, and are subsequently treated, no differently than those
	persons having a traditional high school diploma as a terminal degree.
	The study also indicates that GED graduates are promoted at the same
	rate as regular graduates in less than half of the reporting businesses
	and suggests further research to determine the reasons for the discrepancy.

  abstract = {Abstract: Potential-based reward shaping has been shown to be a powerful
	method to improve the convergence rate of reinforcement learning
	agents. It is a flexible technique to incorporate background knowledge
	into temporal-difference learning in a principled way. However, the
	question remains of how to compute the potential function which is
	used to shape the reward that is given to the learning agent. In
	this paper, we show how, in the absence of knowledge to define the
	potential function manually, this function can be learned online
	in parallel with the actual reinforcement learning process. Two cases
	are considered. The first solution which is based on the multi-grid
	discretisation is designed for model-free reinforcement learning.
	In the second case, the approach for the prototypical model-based
	R-max algorithm is proposed. It learns the potential function using
	the free space assumption about the transitions in the environment.
	Two novel algorithms are presented and evaluated. [Copyright &y&

	to 45 parents of children without disabilities as a control group.
	Parents completed the Family Environment Scale and Social Support
	Scale questionnaires. The comparison revealed significant differences
	for expressiveness and family system organization and for social
	support. Parents with an Asperger child perceived their family's
	expressive feelings as lower and the family organization as higher,
	and perceived their friendships and other support as lower than the
	other groups of parent. Parents of the control group reported the
	highest family support. The study highlighted the need for additional
	social support for parents with a child with special needs, and accentuated
	the importance of developing awareness and intervention programs
	to facilitate parents' coping abilities and their family interactions.

	about the evaluation of educational courseware in higher education.
	Speculation is made on the reasons for the lack of such evaluations.
	The role of checklists for evaluating online courseware is discussed
	despite the acknowledged limitations. Checklists have been developed
	at Edith Cowan University specifically for assessing aspects of online
	pedagogical learning materials in higher education. These checklists
	are intended to be useful indicators of the areas where online learning
	materials are strong and identify areas that may be deficient rather
	than to arrive at a numeric score. The form of checklist proposed
	is a valuable screening device to use before undertaking a context-bound
	evaluation of courseware. Contextual evaluations are a complementary
	and valuable alternative to traditional forms of evaluation of educational
	courseware, such as checklists. A case is also made in this article
	for using a checklist developed for assessing aspects of online pedagogical
	learning materials in higher education. It is argued that, when used
	in conjunction with a context-bound approach, such checklists may
	be more useful in indicating the pedagogical quality of online learning
	materials. Quality of the instructional design remains an important
	consideration in evaluating courseware. Continuing comments and dissent
	are invited on the value of contextual evaluations of educational
	courseware to reinvigorate the debate over appropriate ways of evaluating
	online courseware that will provide helpful information for higher
	education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of British Journal of

	highlighted. In addition, we analyze types of distant-class offerings;
	skills needed for enrollment; design and implementation parameters;
	faculty concerns, including participation, training, salary, workload,
	promotion, and tenure; student interests; and hardware and software
	issues. The department's solutions to commonly encountered problems
	are provided, along with suggestions for engaging the distant learner
	while not alienating the faculty or the traditional student. [ABSTRACT

	number of male and female rebuttals (e.g., explanations and counterchallenges)
	elicited by male versus female challenges, and the frequency of challenges

	that gender differences in communication styles do not necessarily
	produce gender differences in response patterns and participation.
	Other factors such as maleâ€“female ratio and task structures can
	affect gender interaction patterns and gender participation. Nevertheless,
	this study demonstrated how interaction patterns can provide causal
	explanations for observed differences and similarities in male and

	argumentation and the sequential analysis of message-response sequences.
	The findings revealed no differences in number of critiques posted
	in response to arguments because females were just as likely as males
	to critique messages from both males and females, and because females
	responded to males with critiques at a higher than expected frequency.
	Posthoc analysis revealed strong indications that females posted
	fewer rebuttals to the critiques of females than males, and males
	posted more rebuttals to the critiques of females than females. The
	methods used in this study illustrate a process-oriented approach

	developed to investigate the role of critical discourse in higher,
	distance education contexts. Using the quantitative content analysis
	technique, the postings of 19 students in an undergraduate university
	course were assigned to one of the four categories of cognitive presence.
	Across the five activities, the proportion and number of contributions
	categorised in the highest phases of cognitive presence was low (20.21%),
	but was highest during the Webquest and debate activities. There
	are three advantageous qualities of these two activities, we argue:
	1. They were well structured. 2. They provided clearly defined roles

	Centre in Cardiff, Rhys Davies, a researcher for the School of Education
	at the University of Wales, and Amy Bryant, a psychology student
	at Cardiff University, report on their investigations into teachers'
	and general practitioners' (GPs') knowledge of six specific learning
	difficulties. It was hypothesised that the knowledge of both groups
	would be similar. The recent development of a labelling culture has
	resulted in confusion over the terms and the actual difficulties
	encountered by the individual. The authors asked 105 teachers and
	105 GPs to define six categories of learning difficulties (dyspraxia;
	developmental co-ordination disorder (DCD); attention deficit disorder
	(ADD); deficit in attention, motor control and perception (DAMP);
	Asperger's syndrome; and dyslexia) on a questionnaire. The teachers
	gave significantly more correct definitions than the GPs. However,
	knowledge from both professional groups was limited, with correct
	responses only demonstrating a cursory awareness. There are implications
	for both groups of professionals. Teachers will not be able to recognise
	or accommodate the child with learning difficulties in class if their
	knowledge is limited. Similarly GPs will find it difficult to detect
	and appropriately refer children with learning difficulties. Finally,
	and most importantly, there are implications for the identification
	and support of the child, in both the short term and the long term,
	and associated psychological issues such as lowered self-esteem,
	depression and anxiety. Amanda Kirby, Rhys Davies and Amy Bryant
	make suggestions for improving the level of knowledge among professionals
	through training and discuss, in this engaging and frequently amusing

	VLE resources, directed tasks can be put in place that will encourage
	students to adopt the learning strategy that is most closely associated
	with this higher achievement. The different approaches adopted by
	undergraduates (n = 46) in their use of online learning resources
	for a single second-year module are evaluated by analysing their
	record of accessing these resources at three time-points during the
	module, and their performance in coursework and exams. From these
	longitudinal data, three learning approaches are identified (two
	surface and one deep). It is found that students who adopted a deep
	learning approach, in which online resources were accessed consistently
	throughout the module, performed markedly higher than surface learners
	who focused their online activity at the beginning or end of the
	module's duration. Implications for teaching strategies are discussed.

  __markedentry = {[wendy]},
  abstract = {This paper reviews research published in the last 20 years which evaluates
	the performance of general education development (GED) certified
	students at public two-year community colleges. First, information
	is provided on the role and enrollment conditions of today's community
	colleges in America, focusing on the growth of community college,
	diversity of student needs, degree completion, students' uses of
	community colleges, and measures of success in community colleges.
	The first set of studies reviewed compared GED and high school diploma
	(HSD) students who graduated from a community college, and GED and
	HSD students who were academically successful. Indications were that
	among graduates academic achievement was not affected by status of
	high school completion; and that among academically successful students,
	traditional HSD students needed reinforcement skills at the same
	level as GED recipients; that GED and HSD students succeeded equally
	well; and that GED recipients were highly successful and high achievers.
	The next group of studies compared GED and HSD students among new
	enrollees. The studies' major conclusions were: (1) there were not
	significant differences in persistence rates; (2) GED students did
	not achieve the same degree of academic success as HSD students;
	(3) GED students were more likely to be older and female, with no
	significant differences in the academic performance of the two groups;
	(4) the GED is a valid and reliable student entrance certificate;
	and (5) full-time GED student had lower grade point averages and
	complete fewer credits, though there were no differences among part-time
	GED and HSD students. The final set of studies compared GED students
	with all other enrollees. Three studies revealing no significant
	differences. One study showed higher achievement for HSD students,
	and one study showed higher achievement for GED students. Contains
	40 references and 7 tables. (KP)},

	pervasive developmental disorders (PDD). The objective of this study
	was to assess the internal validity of the DSM as a conceptual model
	for describing PDD, while paying particular attention to certain
	subject characteristics. Methods: Parents and teachers completed
	a DSM-IV-referenced rating scale for 3- to 12-year-old clinic referrals
	with a PDD (n = 730). Ratings were submitted to confirmatory factor
	analysis and different models were assessed for fit. Results: Measures
	of fit indicated that the three-factor solution based on the DSM
	was superior to other models. Most indices of fit were acceptable,
	but showed room for improvement. Fit indices varied according to
	the rater (parent or teacher), child's age (preschool versus school
	aged), PDD subtype (autism, Asperger's, pervasive developmental disorder
	not otherwise specified (PDDNOS)), and IQ. Conclusions: More research
	needs to be done before discarding current classification systems.
	Subject characteristics, modality of assessment, and procedural variations
	in statistical analyses impact conclusions about the structure of
	PDD symptoms.},

  abstract = {Purpose - This study aims to propose a conceptual structural equation
	model to investigate the relationships among e-learning system quality,
	e-learning readiness, e-learners' competency as well as learning
	outcomes, and to demonstrate the direct and indirect effect of e-learning
	system quality and e-learning readiness on learning outcomes from
	the perspectives of e-learners' competency. Design/methodology/approach
	- A questionnaire was distributed to 379 full-time employees from
	ten technological companies in Taiwan who have had e-learning experience
	(n = 379). Data were analyzed by employing structural equation modeling.
	Findings - Results reveal that both e-learning system quality and
	e-learning readiness have a direct and significant impact on e-learners'
	competency. However, e-learning system quality and e-learning readiness
	influence learning outcomes indirectly through e-learners' competency.
	In addition, e-learners' competency has direct and positive significant
	influence on learning outcomes. Practical implications - Based on
	these findings, organizations in Taiwan that would like to implement
	e-learning with their employees should focus on improving individuals'
	online learning skills such as self-direction, meta-cognitive, and
	collaborative skills. Originality/value - The findings created an
	understanding of what attributes of external and internal factors
	influence the outcome of e-learning in high tech companies. In terms
	of research contributions, the study extends previous researches
	by identifying the mediating effect of e-learning competency on the
	relationship between e-learning system quality, e-learning readiness
	and learning outcome. Organizations that would like to adopt e-learning
	to improve employees' knowledge and skills will be able to apply
	strategies based on the findings from the research. [ABSTRACT FROM

	represent best practices from clinical experience and research findings.
	It is important to note that these guidelines will be most helpful
	in responding to needs of young children with autism, between the

  abstract = {This study examined differences in the ability to decode emotion through
	facial expression, prosody, and verbal content between 14 children
	with Asperger's Syndrome (AS) and 16 typically developing peers.
	The ability to decode emotion was measured by the Perception of Emotion
	Test (POET), which portrayed the emotions of happy, angry, sad, and
	neutral among the modalities of static and dynamic facial expression,
	prosody, verbal content, and all modalities combined. Results revealed
	that children with AS had more difficulty identifying emotions through
	static facial expression, dynamic facial expression, and prosody
	than typically developing children. Results are discussed in relationship
	to an over-reliance on verbal content as a compensatory strategy
	in social interactions. Treatment implications for individuals with
	AS are also discussed. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.},

	In addition, parents reported a significant improvement in adaptability
	and reduction in unusual behavior for their children. In contrast,
	staff reports reflected no significant change in adaptability and

	sample of U. S. high school graduating seniors and (2) the National
	Survey of GED Examinees (adults). Results of these two studies provided
	the data for this study, which comparerd the performance on the GED
	tests of graduating high school seniors and GED examinees. The percentiles
	and average standard scores for GED examinees show achievement levels
	only slightly below the levels for graduating high school seniors.
	Detailed analyses indicated that graduating high school seniors outperformed
	GED examinees in 20 of the 22 test content areas in the GED battery.
	Statistically significant differences occurred in the areas of Capitalization
	and Punctuation, Usage, and Sentence Correction on the Writing Skills
	test, and Algebra on the Mathematics test. GED graduates outperformed
	graduating high school seniors in 18 of the 22 content areas in the
	GED battery. Statistically significant differences occurred in the
	areas of General Reading and Prose Literature on the Reading Skills
	test. However, the magnitude of the differences between graduating
	high school seniors and GED graduates was small. (Author/JAZ)},

	professionals embarking on professional development online. It is
	argued that the barriers to successful completion identified in the

	social systems in which professional learners are embedded. A "person-in-context"
	perspective is proposed to examine the situatedness of professional
	online learning challenges. Indepth interviews with 30 media professionals
	who started a course, gradually disengaged, and finally, dropped
	out were completed. The situative analysis highlighted how challenges
	emerged at the intersection of work, home, and study environments.
	Three major educational issues for the development of professional
	online learning are identified: the importance of recognising professional
	study as an integral part of work; the significance of congruence
	between online study features and professional learners' characteristics;
	and, the need for course developers to further enhance their technological
	and pedagogical capacity in the area of professional online learning.

	Chi-square and t-tests were used to analyze the data, yielding such
	findings as the following: (1) no effects on the demographic and
	academic composition of examinees were found; (2) the 1989 examinees
	significantly increased their academic preparation efforts; (3) significantly
	higher percentages of 1989 examinees failed to obtain minimum and
	average scores required for passing; (4) 1989 examinees were significantly
	more likely to enroll in further education or training programs;
	(5) 1989 examinees had significantly lower incomes and were more
	likely to be unemployed than 1986 examinees, but 1989 examinees who
	passed the GED tests were significantly more likely to be employed
	than those who failed; (6) with each increase in the minimum score
	requirement, there were correspondingly greater increases in the
	variances between the lowest and highest scores on the five tests
	but only small increases for the norming sample. The study recommended
	keeping the new higher minimum score requirement but lowering the
	five-test average score for passing; further study of the GED tests

  __markedentry = {[wendy]},
  abstract = {Background: Autism exists across a wide spectrum and there is considerable
	debate as to whether children with Asperger's syndrome, who have
	normal language milestones, should be considered to comprise a subgroup
	distinct other from high-functioning children with autism (HFA),
	who have a history of delayed language development. Magnetic resonance
	imaging (MRI) studies of autism are in disagreement. One possible
	reason is that the diagnosis of autism takes precedence over Asperger's
	syndrome and a distinction in language acquisition is rarely made.
	We therefore planned to examine a whole brain hypothesis that the
	patterns of grey matter differences in Asperger's syndrome and HFA
	can be distinguished. Methods: We used voxel-based computational
	morphometry to map grey matter volume differences in 33 children
	with either Asperger's syndrome or high-functioning autism compared
	to 55 typical developing control children balanced for age, IQ, gender,
	maternal language and ethnicity. Results: Children with HFA had significantly
	smaller grey matter volumes in subcortical, posterior cingulate and
	precuneus regions than the Asperger's group. Compared to controls,
	children with HFA had smaller grey matter volumes in predominantly
	fronto-pallidal regions, while children with Asperger's had less
	grey matter in mainly bilateral caudate and left thalamus. In addition
	we found a significant negative correlation between the size of a
	grey matter cluster around BA44 language area and the age of acquisition
	of phrase speech in the children with HFA. When the groups were combined
	we confirmed a mixed picture of smaller grey matter volumes in frontal,
	basal ganglia, temporal and parietal regions. Conclusions: Our study
	suggests that the underlying neurobiology in HFA and Asperger's syndrome
	is at least partly discrete. Future studies should therefore consider
	the history of language acquisition as a valuable tool to refine
	investigation of aetiological factors and management options in pervasive
	developmental disorders. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.},

  __markedentry = {[wendy]},
  abstract = {Background: Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) present
	with a particular profile of memory deficits, executive dysfunction
	and impaired social interaction that may raise concerns about their
	recall and reliability in forensic and legal contexts. Extant studies
	of memory shed limited light on this issue as they involved either
	laboratory-based tasks or protocols that varied between participants.
	Method: The current study used a live classroom event to investigate
	eye-witness recall and suggestibility in children with Asperger syndrome
	(AS group; N = 24) and typically developing children (TD group; N
	= 27). All participants were aged between 11 and 14 years and were
	interviewed using a structured protocol. Two measures of executive
	functioning were also administered. Results: The AS group were found
	to be no more suggestible and no less accurate than their peers.
	However, free recall elicited less information, including gist, in
	the AS group. TD, but not AS, participants tended to focus on the
	socially salient aspects of the scene in their free recall. Both
	general and specific questioning elicited similar numbers of new
	details in both groups. Significant correlations were found between
	memory recall and executive functioning performance in the AS group
	only. Conclusions: The present study indicates that children with
	AS can act as reliable witnesses but they may be more reliant on
	questioning to facilitate recall. Our findings also provide evidence
	for poor gist memory. It is speculated that such differences stem
	from weak central coherence and lead to a reliance on generic cognitive
	processes, such as executive functions, during recall. Future studies
	are required to investigate possible differences in compliance, rates
	of forgetting and false memory. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.},

	are held responsible for fulfilling their roles in providing education

	justifying a critical assessment. We discuss common challenges impeding

	Even though intrinsic subject matter difficulties (20 are listed)
	contribute to this, the excessive reliance on significance testing
	is partly responsible (Ronald A. Fisher). Karl Popper's approach,
	with modifications, would be prophylactic. Since the null hypothesis
	is quasi-always false, tables summarizing research in terms of patterns
	of "significant differences" are little more than complex, causally
	uninterpretable outcomes of statistical power functions. Multiple
	paths to estimating numerical point values ("consistency tests")
	are better, even if approximate with rough tolerances; and lacking
	this, ranges, orderings, 2nd-order differences, curve peaks and valleys,
	and function forms should be used. Such methods are usual in developed
	sciences that seldom report statistical significance. Consistency
	tests of a conjectural taxometric model yielded 94% success with

	difficulties with imaginative, social, and communication skills and
	the presence of repetitive interests and behaviours. A number of
	models have been proposed to help explain the AD phenotype; however,
	these theories have not fully accounted for the social difficulties
	present in individuals with AD. The concept of emotional intelligence
	(EI) may offer insight into the social and emotional behaviours exhibited
	by young adults with AD. In addition, the concept of resilience,
	or the capacity for individuals to cope despite risk, may further
	explain why some individuals with AD experience more successful outcomes
	than others. This study explores EI and resilience in 20 males diagnosed
	with AD with average to above-average cognitive abilities. Various
	aspects of social functioning, EI, and resilience were assessed.
	Results indicate that males with AD displayed intact ability EI;
	however, they did not display typically developed trait EI. Furthermore,
	trait EI was associated with important resilient and adaptive outcomes,
	and these findings provide opportunities for intervention. It is
	important that through the identification of factors that compose
	resilient outcomes, this research represents the first step in identifying
	interventions designed to strengthen protective factors within young
	adults diagnosed with AD.},

	Development (GED) examination in rural and urban sites, a study was
	designed to compare three different types of delivery systems: (1)
	a support program alone without educational television (ETV); (2)
	ETV alone; and (3) ETV plus a personal contact, supplemental training
	support program. Two added conditions were (4) utilization of Kentucky
	Educational Television/GED Skills Packets in individualization of
	the system and (5) a group of students attempting the GED test without
	any known formal preparation. The population consisted of 303 persons
	preparing for the GED over a three year period. Delivery systems
	were compared in terms of the demographic characteristics of the
	students involved with each, and in terms of individual student academic
	skills gain measured by pre- and post-testing of basic skills and/or
	GED attainment. At the time of data analysis eighty-seven persons
	(28.7%) had attempted the GED and 91% were successful. Practical
	significance of the results of the analysis of variance of gain scores
	between students is that there is not much difference among the different
	support conditions, with or without ETV. It was concluded that ETV
	teaches as well as any other instructional method, that successful
	delivery of adult education and student achievement are dependent
	more on the nature of the client than upon the teaching/learning
	system, and that the greatest need in adult education calls for differentiation--varying
	procedures and response to varying needs. (Included are a literature
	review on previous efforts and research into uses of TV for GED preparation,
	description of the ETV program development, and complete data tables

  abstract = {This paper addresses the dilemma faced by the requirement that educators
	provide appropriate and effective education for higher functioning
	students with autism, while lacking the necessary knowledge to provide
	such interventions. The first section discusses the diagnosis of
	autism (especially noting the presence of a "triad" of deficits including
	impaired social relatedness, impaired language, and restricted range
	of activities/interests that allow an "autistic spectrum" diagnosis.)
	The discussion notes the common presence of mental retardation in
	the diagnosis of autism and the inclusion of autism within the broader
	term, "pervasive developmental disorders." However, the emphasis
	of this paper is on higher functioning students with either Asperger's
	Syndrome or Pervasive Developmental Delay conditions that are more
	difficult conditions to describe adequately since there is not yet
	any established definition or diagnostic criteria for high-functioning
	autism. The next section looks at special education in the United
	States under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).
	It suggests that the classification of autistic spectrum disorder
	as defined by IDEA is useful, since the "triad" of weaknesses diagnostic
	of the autistic condition provides important functional information.
	A section on educational interventions and considerations stresses
	the importance of providing children diagnosed as autistic spectrum
	students with structure, visual aids, intervention in language pragmatics
	and social skills, recognition of fixations and special talents,
	and medication. Two cases illustrate these principles. Recommendations
	for educating higher functioning autistic spectrum students focus
	on providing school personnel with the information they need to educate
	these students both at the preservice and inservice levels. Appended
	are the test data summary sheets. (Contains 36 references.) (DB)},

	desired objectives, Jane was in some ways similar to Joe, and in

	using an alternative login. Students interacted with Jane during
	the eight-week course, not knowing she was not a real student. We
	designed Jane to fit unobtrusively into the particular cohort so
	that students could identify with her. We investigated how the class
	experienced her presence. This paper describes how we designed her

	(GED) examination or gone back to school and those who have not completed
	high school. By 1990, young adults with a GED were more likely to
	have attended either a third or fourth year of high school than other
	dropouts. For both males and females, those who did not attain a
	high school diploma before age 20 did not do as well as a group in
	the labor market as those who did. Females who took advantage of
	a second chance to complete high school usually had higher annual
	earnings than those who did not, and those who received a diploma
	or GED before age 20 were more likely to be employed. Two tables
	and three graphs illustrate these findings and trends in employment.

	to help formulate ways schools could prevent students from dropping
	out and ideas on how to create advertising about available adult
	education to which such dropouts would be receptive. A former in-home
	adult education teacher conducted interviews with teachers, guidance
	counselors, parents, and students for 4 months. The following results
	were reported for the 100 dropouts: (1) 26 said they dropped out
	because they were pregnant; (2) 16 said they dropped out because
	they lost interest in school; (3) 15 were children of divorced or
	separated parents; (4) 12 said they had a bad home situation that
	included such problems as drug or alcohol abuse and incest; (5) 7
	said they dropped out to get married; (6) 7 moved or transferred
	to another school; (7) 6 said they dropped out after getting suspended
	and/or expelled; (8) 5 returned to classes and got their General
	Educational Development certificate; (9) 4 got jobs; and (10) 2 were
	enrolled in GED classes at the time of the interviews. It was concluded
	that dropouts are not interested in returning to class the first
	year after leaving school so that it may be pointless to advertise
	adult education to them until they become mature enough to realize
	the value of furthering their education. Dropout prevention in the
	form of sex education that begins at a preteen age level and more
	time for students to talk about home and school problems with counselors

	aid is usually provided to community colleges for ABE/GED instruction;
	(3) benefits from delivering ABE and GED through community colleges

	a greater variety of adults. Appendixes include an article on ABE

	factors, and the inadequacies of the general equivalency diploma
	(GED) and alternative high school curricula, this study consulted
	GED students to determine the factors contributing to their dropping
	out of high school. The study also explored students' reasons for
	attending GED programs, their career aspirations, grade retention
	history, past school attitudes, self-esteem, and academic achievement
	levels. Data were collected via a non-evaluative survey instrument,
	using a sample of 200 adults enrolled in the GED program at Thornton
	Community College (Chicago, Illinois). Only 89 of the questionnaires
	were usable; 90 percent of respondents were black. The self-devised
	instrument contained 10 personal data items, 35 dropout factor items,
	and three open-ended questions on GED enrollment, aspirations, number
	of years since leaving school, and reasons for returning to school.
	Findings show that very few sampled adults had been in trouble with
	the law, influenced adversely by peers, involved in gangs, suspended
	from school, abused as children, absent, ill, disabled, afraid to
	go to school, or raised in a dangerous community. Data suggest that
	poverty and socioeconomic background were contributing factors to
	dropout rates. Both sexes realized they needed an education to succeed
	in life; many wanted to continue their education, secure employment,
	or advance in their jobs. A significant number desired to attend
	college. Recommendations for keeping youth in school are given. Included

	This article explains the methods used by the author and several

	courses based on the author's extensive experience with conducting
	such debates in a wide range of classes, and the contributions such
	an approach has demonstrated on student understanding and communication
	of political issues. Topics addressed include differences in debate
	format and preparation for different class levels and sizes; how
	to accommodate students of different abilities through effective
	team and role management; grading options/methods of evaluation;
	and approaches to engaging the entire classroom in this active learning
	exercise. Evaluation of the merits of the approach also is provided

	Correlations were run suggesting that significant relationships exist
	between college grade point average and each of three variables:
	GED composite scores, enrollment ages, and GED reading test scores.
	A comparison of frequency distributions suggested that, although
	the level of GED scores is not a significant factor, age is a significant
	factor in successful course completion. A higher proportion of older
	students achieved success than those students under 25 years of age.
	It was concluded that GED graduates can be expected to experience
	difficulties not limited to academic unpreparedness in their first

  abstract = {The number of adult learners who participate in online learning has
	rapidly grown in the last two decades due to online learning's many
	advantages. In spite of the growth, the high dropout rate in online
	learning has been of concern to many higher education institutions
	and organizations. The purpose of this study was to determine whether
	persistent learners and dropouts are different in individual characteristics
	(i.e., age, gender, and educational level), external factors (i.e.,
	family and organizational supports), and internal factors (i.e.,
	satisfaction and relevance as sub-dimensions of motivation). Quantitative
	data were collected from 147 learners who had dropped out of or finished
	one of the online courses offered from a large Midwestern university.
	Dropouts and persistent learners showed statistical differences in
	perceptions of family and organizational support, and satisfaction
	and relevance. It was also shown that the theoretical framework,
	which includes family support, organizational support, satisfaction,
	and relevance in addition to individual characteristics, is able
	to predict learners' decision to drop out or persist. Organizational
	support and relevance were shown to be particularly predictive. The
	results imply that lower dropout rates can be achieved if online
	program developers or instructors find ways to enhance the relevance
	of the course. It also implies that adult learners need to be supported
	by their organizations in order for them to finish online courses
	that they register for. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal

  abstract = {For most high school non-completers, the GED[R] credential provides
	a bridge to postsecondary education, but little is known about how
	successfully GED (General Educational Development) Test candidates
	make that transition and whether enrollment rates change with time.
	The American Council on Education (ACE) has begun a three-year longitudinal
	study to understand the effect of the GED credential on postsecondary
	enrollment, persistence, and completion. This study reports the latest
	data available from a 2003 cohort of GED candidates who tested shortly
	after the introduction of the current 2002 Series GED Tests. This
	study is in support of a new effort to transition adults without
	a high school diploma to the GED credential and career and college
	readiness via accelerated learning. The initiative is a comprehensive,
	multiyear program designed to dramatically increase the numbers of
	individuals who earn the GED credential. It consists of three key
	components: education and preparation; enhanced career- and college-ready
	assessment aligned with the Common Core State Standards and enhanced
	credentialing process; and connections and transition services to
	postsecondary education and career opportunities. The 148,649 GED
	Test passers in the 2003 cohort study attended 2,787 postsecondary
	institutions throughout the United States. The vast majority of students
	who had passed the GED Test initially enrolled in colleges offering
	programs of two years or fewer; 77.8 percent enrolled in public two-year
	or fewer-than-two-year institutions. The majority of passers in the
	2003 cohort who enrolled in postsecondary institutions enrolled within
	the first three years after passing the test (i.e., 2003, 2004, or
	2005) and tended to take their time to progress in postsecondary
	programs, perhaps at a less consistent pace than other adult learners.
	A majority (66.6 percent) who enrolled maintained enrollment for
	two or more semesters, yet only 11.8 percent of 2003 passers who
	enrolled graduated from a postsecondary program by September 2009.
	Major findings of interest in this first year of a three-year study
	reflect a positive relationship between the GED credential and entering
	postsecondary education. Findings of predictive survival analyses
	for event occurrence of postsecondary enrollment and graduation are
	presented in this report. Other results include comparisons between
	postsecondary institutions that GED credential recipients attend
	and postsecondary institutions in general, and between GED credential
	recipients and traditional high school graduates. A discussion of
	findings and their implications for future longitudinal research
	follow. (Contains 31 tables, 25 figures, and 37 footnotes.)},

	Delayed diagnosis can have disastrous effects on the mental state

	being mystified and frustrated with their children's lack of social
	tact and intense interests that preoccupy them to the exclusion of
	peer relations. As their children age, poor relatedness, odd preoccupations,
	and sometimes a lack of motivation are noted as well at school. The

	explore links between social behavior and theory of mind (ToM) have
	produced mixed results, especially for children on the autism spectrum.
	The present pair of studies developed a psychometrically sound, age-referenced
	measure of social maturity to explore these issues further. Method:
	In Study 1, 37 typically developing preschoolers took a battery of
	standard false belief tests of ToM and were rated by their teachers
	on a newly developed age-referenced social maturity scale with 7
	items. In Study 2, a further group of 43 children aged 4 to 12 years
	(13 with autism, 14 with Asperger's disorder and 16 with typical
	development) took part in the same procedure. Results: In Study 1,
	ToM was found to predict typical preschoolers' social maturity independently
	of age and verbal maturity. In Study 2, children with autism scored
	below age-matched and younger typical developers in both ToM and
	social maturity. Those with Asperger's disorder did well on ToM but
	poorly on social maturity. Study 2 replicated Study l's finding (for
	typical children and for the full sample) that ToM was linked with
	social maturity independently of age and verbal ability, although
	the link was not independent of autism diagnosis. Conclusions: Teachers
	are capable of rating children's social behavior with peers as advanced,
	on-time or delayed for their age. Suggestive links between these
	ratings and ToM require further investigation, especially among children
	on the autism spectrum. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.},

	of Education and the area's Private Industry Council have worked
	together to provide literacy-enhancing classes at worksites for persons
	in the county whose jobs represent 15 different employers. These
	employers have recognized the problems of workers with poor literacy
	and deficient basic skills, and they have chosen to attack the problem
	by providing educational opportunities at their worksites. Almost
	400 employees participated in various types of adult basic education
	(ABE) classes supported with federal funds. Of these, about 54 percent
	were taking high school equivalency programs, 23 percent were in
	ABE classes, 18 percent were in English-as-a-Second Language (ESL)
	classes, and about 6 percent were studying for their General Educational
	Development (GED) diploma. Teachers used any materials they found
	appropriate, and also developed materials specific to some worksites.
	The classes initially ran for 40 hours. The project facilitator and
	counselors regularly visited classes to make students aware of help
	available. After 40 hours, some classes stopped because they had
	attained their goals, while others continued enthusiastically and
	also added new students. (Descriptions of the individual classes
	held at the various worksites and handwritten comments from students
	are included in this report.) (KC)},

  abstract = {Purpose: This article reports a study in which referential communication

	compared between text chat and telephone, using a route-solving task.
	Method: Participants deduced routes by asking closed questions, and
	the dependent variables were (a) accuracy in working out the route,
	(b) number of questions posed (turns taken), and (c) time taken to
	complete the task. Results: Generally, individuals with AS were equally
	competent in solving the task in both media but less efficient than
	the typically developing comparison group. Individuals with AS who
	had higher measured executive ability adopted a similar approach
	to the comparison group, asking about landmarks on the map to deduce
	the route taken. In contrast, AS participants with lower executive
	ability used an inefficient left/right questioning strategy, which
	occupied more time, required more conversational turns, and was associated
	with a higher rate of error. Conclusion: Individuals with AS, who
	also have problems of executive functioning, may have difficulty
	communicating with others to use a route-solving task. Reprinted

	three instructional strategies used in the development and implementation
	of online discussion questions were examined: a case-based discussion,
	a debate, and an open-ended (or topical) discussion. Using a mixed
	method approach, the study focused on critical thinking levels as
	described in the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework and operationalized
	in the Practical Inquiry Model (PIM). The study investigated (1)
	participants'' preferred instructional strategy and rationales for
	the selection, (2) the contribution of student background and demographic
	criteria to students'' preferred instructional strategy, (3) the
	contribution of students'' strategy preferences in predicting level
	of critical thinking, based on the Practical Inquiry Model''s (PIM)
	indicators, and (4) comparisons of participants'' critical thinking
	levels across instructional strategies. Implications for the design
	of online discussions that foster critical thinking are discussed.

  abstract = {Background: Data from epidemiology have consistently highlighted a
	disparity between the true prevalence of childhood psychiatric disorders
	and their recognition as defined by receiving a clinical diagnosis.
	Few studies have looked specifically at the level of unidentified
	autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) in the population. Method: Logistic
	regression was used to determine the behavioural traits associated
	with receiving a diagnosis of ASD using data from the Avon Longitudinal
	Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). A composite score was derived
	to measure levels of autistic traits; undiagnosed children with scores
	matching those diagnosed with ASD were identified. Levels of educational
	provision beyond that provided by standard schooling were examined.
	Results: Fifty-five percent of children with autistic traits at the
	same levels as those who had an autism diagnosis had not been identified
	as needing extra support from education or specialised health services.
	Of those who were identified as having special needs, 37.5% had been
	formally diagnosed with an ASD. For children with impairment at the
	same level as that associated with Asperger's syndrome, 57% had no
	special provision at school, and were not accessing specialised health
	services. Twenty-six percent of those who did have special provision
	at school had an ASD diagnosis. Conclusions: The results suggest
	that there may be a substantial proportion of children on the autistic
	spectrum who are never identified by services.},

	Non-verbal visual puns, semantic and Theory of Mind cartoons were
	rated on comprehension, funniness and the punchlines were explained.
	AS individuals did not differ to the control group in humor appreciation
	of visual puns. However, they had difficulty understanding and appreciating
	Theory of Mind cartoons and provided mentalistic explanations less
	frequently than controls suggesting that humor processing is strongly
	related to the cognitive requirements that the stimuli pose on the
	perceiver. Furthermore, AS individuals referred in all conditions
	more frequently to non-joke relevant details. Therefore, humor processing
	is also influenced by their detail-oriented processing style.},

	GED (General Educational Development) Tests Reliability refers to
	the consistency, or stability, of test scores when the authors administer
	the measurement procedure repeatedly to groups of examinees (American
	Educational Research Association [AERA], American Psychological Association
	[APA], and National Council on Measurement in Education [NCME], 1999).
	If a given test yields widely discrepant scores for the same individual
	on separate test administrations, and the individual does not change
	significantly on the measured attribute, then the scores on the test
	are not reliable. Conversely, if a test produces the same or similar
	scores for an individual on separate administrations, then the scores
	from the test are considered reliable. Reliability is inversely related
	to the amount of measurement error in test scores. That is, the more
	measurement error present in test scores, the less reliable the test.
	Reliability is a crucial index of test quality. Standard practices
	require test developers to evaluate and report the reliability of
	their test scores. The purpose of this report was to estimate and
	evaluate the reliability of the internationally administered 2002

	for interaction in learning environments. Students in face-to-face
	learning environments process social information about others in
	order to assess traits, predict behaviors, and determine qualifications
	for assuming particular responsibilities within a group. In online
	learning environments, however, negotiating social information and
	maintaining social connectedness can pose challenges for participants.
	Nonverbal strategies one typically uses for enhancing communication
	and overcoming ambiguity - such as an approving smile or a questioning
	brow - must be approached differently while learning online where
	fewer sensory communication channels are typically available. We
	present the theoretical foundation for how social information processing
	and group structure theories may be combined to assist instructional
	designers in further examining the social system perceived by the
	online learner. We propose a framework for thinking more systematically
	about the development of group social structure in online learning
	environments. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Distance Education

	performance to national norms on the General Educational Development

	the first study, a representative sample of 1,200 high school seniors
	completed two of the battery of five tests of the GED in Spring 1984.
	Means and standard deviations for the five tests and intercorrelations
	among the five tests were calculated in order to compare the Florida
	data with the national data, which were based on a sample of about
	700 high school students tested in the spring of 1980. The study
	found that Florida's seniors compare quite favorably. Mean scale
	scores were higher than the national norm on all tests and noticeably
	higher on the science and mathematics tests. Performance in the upper
	score ranges on the writing skills, social studies, science, and
	reading skills was slightly less than that of the national sample,
	but from the midpoint down, Florida's seniors outperformed the national
	group. In the second study, the names of the students who had taken
	the GED test samples were matched to those students who had also
	taken the SSAT-II; a 79 percent match was found. Correlations, although
	sketchy, showed that it is fairly safe to predict that students who
	cannot pass the SSAT-II have little chance of passing the GED tests
	and hence that the GED tests are more difficult and do not represent
	an "out" for students who cannot earn a diploma in regular high school

  abstract = {In preparation for adding an essay test to the General Educational
	Development (GED) test, the GED Testing Service undertook a series
	of studies to establish (1) whether acceptable reading reliabilities
	were attainable in decentralized holistic scoring sessions often
	involving no more than a dozen papers; (2) whether essay readers
	in a variety of locations, employing a variety or procedures, could
	consistently apply the same essay scoring standards (i.e., achieve
	scale stability); and (3) whether an essay would measure aspects
	of writing performance different from those currently measured by
	the multiple-choice test. The research studies involved the holistic
	scoring of essays written by more than 2,000 GED examinees from Washington,
	D.C., Iowa, and Maryland, and by a national sample of almost 4,000
	high school seniors. Results indicate that acceptable levels of reading
	reliability are possible in decentralized scoring sessions. However,
	two studies of essay scoring scale stability yielded different results,
	demonstrating the need for additional monitoring techniques during
	scoring sessions to ensure that the score scale remains constant.
	To determine whether an essay represents a measure clearly different
	from the multiple-choice writing test, standard scores on the current
	GED Writing Skills (multiple-choice) test were correlated with holistic
	scores on an essay test. The extent of these correlations indicates
	that the two tests are measuring related but clearly different set
	of skills. The GED Testing Service plans to conduct additional research
	to identify the most effective methods for maintaining scoring scale
	stability in essay scoring sessions conducted in a variety of settings
	and to ensure that scores earned by students on different essay topics
	are comparable. (Author/KC)},

	test and (2) examining the relationship of time spent in writing
	essays with scores on the essay tests. In the spring of 1984, the

	one topic received different scores on different topics. The range
	of values for the correlations between the indirect and direct measures
	of writing indicates that there is a substantial relationship between
	the two, but that the essay and multiple-choice tests are measuring
	somewhat different skills. Similarly, the range of correlations between
	scores on essays in different rhetorical modes suggests that these
	modes tap slightly different writing skills. Finally, a positive
	but weak relationship was found for students writing on the description

	developed as a new component to an introductory core course for first-professional
	year pharmacy students. Objectives were to facilitate the group process,
	introduce controversial issues related to the US healthcare system,
	improve critical thinking and communication skills, enable students'
	ability to analyze and evaluate evidence, help develop skills in
	formulating written arguments, and encourage tolerance of diverse
	points of view. Design. One hundred sixty-two students were assigned
	to 40 teams (half assigned to argue as "Pros" and half as "Cons")
	and paired into 20 debating groups. The paired teams posted 3 arguments
	in an online forum alternatively over a 12-week period. The winning
	teams were determined by a panel of 3 judges. Assessment. Feedback
	from the judges was posted online and summarized in an in-class discussion.
	Thematic analysis of qualitative data from students and faculty members
	demonstrated the effectiveness of the online debate component in
	helping students work together in a group, learn alternative sides
	of complex issues, and write persuasive arguments. Conclusion. This
	novel online-debate forum was a feasible teaching and learning strategy,
	which helped pharmacy students improve their communication skills
	and critical thinking, expanded their scope of knowledge, and provided
	a platform for group process. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of

	trajectories of high-functioning children with autism spectrum disorders
	(ASD) from early childhood to adolescence using the presence and
	absence of structural language impairment (StrLI) as a way of differentiating
	autism from Asperger syndrome (AS). Method: Sixty-four high-functioning
	children with ASD were ascertained at 4-6 years of age from several
	different regional diagnostic and treatment centers. At 6-8 years
	of age, the ADI-R and the Test of Oral Language Development were
	used to define an autism group (those with StrLI at 6-8 years of
	age) and an AS group (those without StrLI). Growth curve analysis
	was then used to chart the developmental trajectories of these children
	on measures of autistic symptoms, and adaptive skills in communication,
	daily living and socialization. Results: Differentiating the ASD
	group in terms of the presence/absence of StrLI provided a better
	explanation of the variation in growth curves than not differentiating
	high-functioning ASD children. The two groups had similar developmental
	trajectories but the group without StrLI (the AS group) was functioning
	better and had fewer autistic symptoms than the group with StrLI
	(the autism group) on all measures across time. The differences in
	outcome could not be explained by non-verbal IQ or change in early
	language skills. Conclusion: Distinguishing between autism and Asperger
	syndrome based on the presence or absence of StrLI appears to be
	a clinically useful way of classifying ASD sub-types. Reprinted by

  abstract = {This study determined which of three types of educational barriers
	(institutional, situational, or dispositional) represented the major
	problem preventing adult students from completing their general educational
	development (GED) studies at Community College of Philadelphia (CCP)
	in Pennsylvania. A Likert-type survey instrument was used to collect
	data for the survey, which was then sent out to 400 randomly selected
	former students who had been enrolled in the GED program from the
	fall of 1998 through the summer of 1999 from a population of about
	1,200. Of the 400 surveys, 168 were returned, for a response rate
	of 42%. Of these, 124 (31%) were selected for usability. Findings
	include: (1) 60% of respondents were African American, 20% were Latino,
	19% white, and 2% Native American; (2) 52% of respondents were single
	with children; (3) 52% were unemployed, 38% had completed grade levels
	between 6th and 9th grade, and 48% had enrolled in the GED course
	at CCP 2 or 3 times; and (4) of the study participants, 80% never
	completed their GED programs. Results showed most situational barriers
	had slightly higher means: race was not a factor in dropout rates,
	gender was a major factor in dropout rates, marital status was not
	a major factor, and dropout rates were higher among those who were
	employed during the program. The paper recommends that CCP organize
	a distance learning program for those with home responsibilities
	that present obstacles and offer programs at the workplace for those
	with work-related obstacles. Appended are: Survey Questionnaire;
	and Sample of a Reminder Letter. (Contains 16 tables and 38 references.)

  abstract = {A study was conducted to determine factors leading to the success
	of General Educational Development (GED) recipients at North Shore
	Community College (NSCC). The sample population consisted of 160
	GED recipients who had attended more than one semester at NSCC, declared
	a major, and earned a grade point average (GPA) of at least 1.00.
	The survey asked students for background information, reasons they
	enrolled in the GED program, post-GED college experiences, and suggestions
	for the program. Responses from 87 students were analyzed to identify
	the most significant factors influencing the success of GED recipients
	in higher education. Data indicated that GED recipients enrolled,
	matriculated, and earned above average cumulative GPA's in higher
	education. Significant factors in GED recipients' college success
	included self-motivation; referral/support of family, friends, and
	college staff; consistent contact with one program coordinator and/or
	advisor; and use of college services. Six relevant factors were also
	identified: (1) participation in a formal GED preparation program
	and formal completion of at least the 10th grade facilitated success
	in higher education; (2) age was not a significant determinant of
	success; (3) those with higher GED scores did not necessarily go
	on to earn higher cumulative GPA's; (4) working full-time seemed
	to negatively influence academic achievement, while working part-time
	seemed to have no influence; (5) in a multi-campus setting, class
	attendance at two campuses had little effect on cumulative GPA's;
	and (6) students who used public transportation to get to campus
	appeared to have lower cumulative GPA's than those who drove. Appended
	are the survey instruments, data highlights and analysis, and a detailed
	description of the research methodology. (WJT)},

	lessons. First, the presence of the GED option may encourage some
	students to drop out of school. Second, economic benefits associated
	with a GED accrue only to dropouts who leave school with very low
	skills. Third, economic benefits associated with a GED appear over
	time rather than immediately upon receipt of the credential. Fourth,
	the returns to postsecondary education and training are as large
	for GED holders as for regular high school graduates, but GED holders
	obtain very little postsecondary education or on-the-job training.},

	on interstate variation in GED passing standards to address selectivity
	bias issues, the authors find that the GED has a large impact on
	the earnings of young white dropouts who chose to obtain the credential
	and whose scores place them on the margin of passing. While they
	find no statistically discernible effect of the GED on the earnings
	of young minority dropouts, this does not rule out a positive impact
	of the GED on higher scoring minority dropouts nor a positive impact
	on the earnings of minorities via a human capital route.},

	of the HFA and AS groups. Little difference was found between the
	three PDD subtypes with respect to EF. This study supports the view

  abstract = {The medical community understands surprisingly little about autism,
	referred to as autism spectrum disorders (ASD), because its symptoms
	can range from severe to a high-functioning autism, known as Asperger's
	syndrome. There's general agreement that a genetic predisposition
	coupled with unknown environmental triggers may explain what's behind
	it, "but there's no single factor that's been identified as the cause,"
	explains Stanley Greenspan, a child psychiatrist who developed the
	Floortime treatment for autism, which involves a special kind of
	play that follows the child's leads and interests. It's a fact that
	autism rates are rising and not just because of earlier detection
	and a broadening of its definition over the years. As this fast-growing
	disability continues to make front-page news--with the United Nations
	declaring a World Autism Awareness Day and celebrities like Jenny
	McCarthy, Toni Braxton, and Ed Asner continuing to champion awareness
	on behalf of their children with autism--why have libraries been
	slow to catch on? "Largely, we haven't done a good job in teaching
	people about autism," says Brenda Smith Myles, chief of programs
	for the grassroots organization Autism Society of America. "When
	librarians go to school, they don't have courses that talk about
	children with special needs and how to modify programs for them."
	With such an obvious need for more information and no national campaign
	for librarians, a growing number of public libraries across the country
	are taking steps to alert their staff about how to address the needs
	of these children and their families. Although there's no one-size-fits-all
	approach to supporting children with autism, there are some strategies
	that can go a long way when it comes to giving these kids a positive
	library experience--and, one hopes, keep them coming back.},

	and depressive symptoms in adolescents with Asperger's Syndrome (AS).
	Thirty-five adolescents with AS and 35 controls matched on chronological
	age, school year and gender distribution, completed questionnaires
	designed to ascertain the quality of their best-friendship, motivation
	for developing friendships, feelings of loneliness and depressive
	symptomatology. Relative to the comparison group, the participants
	with AS reported poorer quality of best-friendship and less motivation
	to develop friendships. The individuals with AS displayed higher
	levels of loneliness and depressive symptoms, with loneliness being
	negatively correlated with the quality of their best-friendship.
	Increased levels of loneliness in the adolescents with AS was predicted
	by the extent to which their best-friendships were characterized
	by high levels of conflict/betrayal. Increased depressive symptoms
	in the adolescents with AS were also predicted by this factor. The
	findings indicate that increased levels of negative affect may be
	related to the poor quality of social relationships often reported
	in this population. (Contains 2 tables.)},

	the symptoms and functional impairment of a school-age male with
	AS and comorbid disruptive behavior problems. Components of the comprehensive
	treatment included a behavioral summer treatment program, behavioral

  abstract = {<p>This paper focuses on university-level education offered by methods
	of distance learning in the field of computers and aims at the investigation
	of the main causes for student dropouts. The presented study is based
	on the students of the Course of â€œInformaticsâ€�, Faculty of Science
	and Technology of the Hellenic Open University and investigates the
	particularities of education provided through the use of computers
	and technology in general. This paper presents information about
	the students'' profile, the use of computer technology, the percentage
	of dropouts, as well as a classification of the reasons for dropouts
	based on interviews with the students. The study shows that dropouts
	are correlated with the use of technological means and, based on
	this fact, the Hellenic Open University implemented interventions
	in the use of such means. It also proves that a correlation exists
	between dropouts and students'' age, but not gender, although female
	students are more reluctant to start following a course. However,
	it is also shown that female students'' commitment to a course is
	stronger and thus, they do not drop out as easily as male students
	do. Furthermore, the results of this study strongly correlate dropouts
	to the existence of previous education in the field of Informatics
	or to working with computers, but not to the degree of specialisation
	in computers. Finally, the paper presents the reasons provided by
	the students for drooping out, with the main reasons being the inability
	to estimate the time required for university-level studies and the
	perceived difficulty of the computers course.</p> [Copyright &y&

  abstract = {The evidence presented in this paper questions whether the current
	U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) system of in-kind subsidies for
	child care is meeting DoD recruitment, readiness, and retention goals
	or service member needs in an optimal way. DoD appears to be reaping
	limited benefits from the substantial subsidies provided to families
	that use Child Development Centers. Many families cannot or choose
	not to use the subsidized on-base DoD programs; these families receive
	no support for child care costs. The authors' findings suggest that
	the DoD child care system could change in a number of ways to better
	meet DoD and family needs. First, it could redistribute resources
	within the current system. Rethinking priority policies from the
	perspective of both child care need and the degree to which care
	characteristics fit with likely DoD and service member needs would
	be another important way to change the system. DoD may also wish
	to expand the child care benefit to cover more military families
	and a broader set of child care needs. Alternatively, DoD could expand
	access to child care through the use of cash benefits, vouchers,
	and/or negotiated discounts with local providers that meet quality

	fund the salaries of caregivers. Federal dollars pay for supplies,

	is the only service whose centers all meet the accreditation standards
	of the National Association for the Education of Young Children.
	The hourly cost of child care is about 20 percent higher in Air Force
	centers than in civilian centers of comparable quality because Air
	Force labor costs are higher and because a higher proportion of the
	children are younger than three years old. Adjusting estimated costs
	to account for differences in age, the cost per child-hour is about
	seven percent higher in Air Force centers than in civilian centers.
	The Air Force pays its centers' caregivers an average of $11.20 per
	hour in salaries and benefits, $1.04 more than civilian centers pay.
	GAO concludes that, with adjustments for age distribution, the costs
	of high-quality child care in Air Force and civilian centers are
