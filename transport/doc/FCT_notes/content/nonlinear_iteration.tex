\section{Nonlinear Iteration}
\subsection{Steady-State High-Order Scheme}
The high-order steady-state scheme in general is nonlinear:
\begin{equation}
   \A^H(\U^H)\U^H = \b \eqc
\end{equation}
since the high-order diffusion matrix $\D^H(\U^H)$ can be a function
of the solution. If the system is modified to strongly impose Dirichlet
boundary conditions, let it be denoted by
\begin{equation}
   \tilde{\A}^H(\U^H)\U^H = \tilde{\b} \eqc
\end{equation}
where the tilde denotes modification to the vector or matrix.
Defining the steady-state residual as $\r^H$,
\begin{equation}
