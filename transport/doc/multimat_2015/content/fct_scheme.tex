The FCT scheme blends the low-order and high-order schemes
to produce a scheme
that is high-order, positivity-preserving, DMP-satisfying,
and in practice, free of spurious oscillations.
The crux of the flux-corrected transport algorithm is that
antidiffusive fluxes are defined, which when added to the
low-order scheme, produce the high-order scheme solution.
These fluxes $\mathbf{F}$ are then limited to satisfy
physical bounds imposed on the FCT solution.
Here these bounds
are chosen to be the bounds of the low-order scheme discrete
maximum principle, given by Eqn.~\ref{eq:dmp}.
Since $\mathbf{M}^C-\mathbf{M}^L$ and $\mathbf{D}^L-\mathbf{D}^H$ are symmetric
and feature zero row and column sums, a valid decomposition for
the antidiffusive fluxes is

\begin{equation}
   F_{i,j} = -M_{i,j}^C\left(\frac{U^{H,n+1}_j-U^n_j}{\Delta t}
   - \frac{U^{H,n+1}_i-U^n_i}{\Delta t}\right)
   + (D_{i,j}^L-D_{i,j}^H)(U^n_j - U^n_i).
\end{equation}

The FCT scheme is the following, where the operator
$\mathbf{L}$ denotes the limiter operation:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:FCTscheme}
   \mathbf{M}^L\frac{\mathbf{U}^{n+1}-\mathbf{U}^n}{\Delta t}
      + \mathbf{A}^L\mathbf{U}^n
      = \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{L}\cdot\mathbf{F},
\end{equation}

where the notation $\mathbf{L}\cdot\mathbf{F}$ denotes row-wise dot products:
$(\mathbf{L}\cdot\mathbf{F})_i = \sum_j L_{i,j}F_{i,j}$.
The limiting coefficients $L_{i,j}$ are given by the multidimensional
limiter of Zalesak~\cite{zalesak}:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:P_defs}
   F_i^+ \equiv \sum\limits_j\max(0,F_{i,j}) \qquad
   F_i^- \equiv \sum\limits_j\min(0,F_{i,j}),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Q_defs}
      Q_i^\pm \equiv M_{i,i}^L\frac{W_i^\pm-U_i^n}{\Delta t}
      + \sum\limits_j A_{i,j}^L U_j^n - b_i,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:R_defs}
   L_i^\pm \equiv\left\{
      \begin{array}{l l}
         1                                          & F_i^\pm = 0\\
         \min\left(1,\frac{Q_i^\pm}{P_i^\pm}\right) & F_i^\pm \ne 0
      \end{array}
      \right.,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:L_defs}
   L_{i,j} \equiv\left\{
      \begin{array}{l l}
         \min(L_i^+,L_j^-) & F_{i,j} \geq 0\\
         \min(L_i^-,L_j^+) & F_{i,j} < 0
      \end{array}
      \right.,
\end{equation}

where $W_i^\pm$ are the upper and lower discrete maximum principle bounds
given in Eqn.~\ref{eq:dmp}.
Note that the symmetry of the limited coefficients $L_{i,j}=L_{j,i}$ and
antisymmetric correction fluxes $F_{i,j}=-F_{j,i}$ make the FCT scheme conservative, since
the FCT scheme is merely the low-order scheme plus some equal-and-opposite source
terms.
