The high-order scheme is based on the concept of entropy
viscosity introduced by Guermond~\cite{guermond_ev}, which by itself
is not guaranteed to be monotonicity-preserving or positivity-preserving;
however, when used as a component of the flux-corrected transport scheme,
the resulting scheme is positivity-preserving
and satisfies a discrete maximum principle.
The high-order scheme has the form

\begin{equation}\label{eq:highorderscheme}
   \mathbf{M}^C\frac{\mathbf{U}^{H,n+1}-\mathbf{U}^n}{\Delta t}
      +\left(\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{D}^{H,n}\right)\mathbf{U}^n = \mathbf{b},
\end{equation}

where the high-order diffusion operator is computed in the same manner
as its low-order counterpart, but instead, using a high-order viscosity
which uses an entropy viscosity bounded by the low-order viscosity:
$\nu^{H,n}_K = \min(\nu^{L}_K,\nu^{E,n}_K)$. To compute the entropy
viscosity, 
one first decides upon a convex entropy functional $E(u)$ such as $E(u)=\frac{1}{2}u^2$.
The entropy viscosity is designed to add viscosity in regions of entropy
production, such as in shocks or steep gradients, and avoid adding
viscosity elsewhere. This is achieved by computing the entropy viscosity
with an entropy residual:

\begin{equation}
   \nu^{E,n}_K = \frac{c_E R_K^n(u_h^n,u_h^{n-1})
      + c_J\max\limits_{F\in\partial K}J_F(u_h^n)}
      {\|E(u_h^n)-\bar{E}(u_h^n)\|_{L^\infty(\mathcal{D})}},
\end{equation}

where $R_K^n(u_h^n,u_h^{n-1})$ is the entropy residual, $J_F(u_h^n)$
is the jump in entropy flux across face $F$ of cell $K$, $\bar{E}(u_h^n)$ is the average
entropy over the domain, and $c_E$ and $c_J$ are tunable normalization
parameters, usually $\sim 1$.
The entropy residual evaluated with explicit Euler is the following:

\begin{equation}
    R_K^n(u_h^n,u_h^{n-1}) = \left\|\frac{E(u_h^n)-E(u_h^{n-1})}{\Delta t^n}
      + \left.\frac{dE}{du}\right|_{u_h^n}\left[\mathbf{\Omega}\cdot\nabla u_h^n
      + \sigma u_h^n
      - q \right]\right\|_{L^\infty(K)}.
\end{equation}
