The high-order scheme is based on the concept of \underline{\bf entropy
viscosity} introduced by Guermond~\cite{guermond_ev,guermond_secondorder} which, by itself,
does not guaranteed monotonicity-preserving or positivity-preserving.

%however, when used as a component of the flux-corrected transport scheme,
%the resulting scheme is positivity-preserving
%and satisfies a discrete maximum principle.
The high-order scheme has the form

\begin{equation}\label{eq:highorderscheme}
   \mathbf{M}^C\frac{\mathbf{U}^{H,n+1}-\mathbf{U}^n}{\Delta t}
      +\left(\mathbf{A}+\tcr{\mathbf{D}^{H,n}}\right)\mathbf{U}^n = \mathbf{b},
\end{equation}

where the high-order diffusion operator $\tcr{\mathbf{D}^{H}}$ is computed in the same manner
as its low-order counterpart, but employs a high-order viscosity definition
based on an entropy viscosity bounded by the low-order viscosity:
\framebox{$\nu^{H,n}_K = \min(\nu^{L}_K,\nu^{E,n}_K)$.} 

To compute the entropy viscosity $\nu^{E}$, 
one first selects a convex entropy functional $E(u)$, e.g., $E(u)=\tfrac{1}{2}u^2$.

The entropy viscosity is designed \underline{\bf to add viscosity in regions of entropy
production}, such as shocks, and avoids adding viscosity elsewhere. 

Thus, the entropy viscosity is selected proportional to the entropy residual $R_K^n$:
%\begin{equation}
   %\nu^{E,n}_K = \frac{c_E R_K^n(u_h^n,u_h^{n-1})
      %+ c_J\max\limits_{F\in\partial K}J_F(u_h^n)}
      %{\|E(u_h^n)-\bar{E}(u_h^n)\|_{L^\infty(\mathcal{D})}},
%\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\boxed{
   \nu^{E,n}_K = c_E \frac{R_K^n(u_h^n,u_h^{n-1})}      
      {\|E(u_h^n)-\bar{E}(u_h^n)\|_{L^\infty(\mathcal{D})}},
}
\end{equation}
where 
%$R_K^n(u_h^n,u_h^{n-1})$ is the entropy residual, $J_F(u_h^n)$
%is the jump in entropy flux across face $F$ of cell $K$, 
$\bar{E}(u_h^n)$ is the average
entropy over the domain, 
%and $c_E$  and $c_J$ are tunable normalization parameters, 
and $c_E$ is a tunable normalization parameter, 
usually $\sim 1$.

The entropy residual evaluated with explicit Euler is the following:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{
    R_K^n(u_h^n,u_h^{n-1}) = \left\|\frac{E(u_h^n)-E(u_h^{n-1})}{\Delta t^n}
      + \left.\frac{dE}{du}\right|_{u_h^n}\left[\mathbf{\Omega}\cdot\nabla u_h^n
      + \sigma u_h^n
      - q \right]\right\|_{L^\infty(K)}.
}
\end{equation}
