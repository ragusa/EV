The numerical solutions obtained by this scheme
\begin{itemize}
  \item are guaranteed non-negative
  \item are not guaranteed to be monotone, but rarely not monotone in practice
  \item satisfy a discrete maximum principle
  \item are 2nd-order accurate
\end{itemize}

Current and future work includes
\begin{itemize}
  \item implicit time discretizations
  \item conservation law \emph{systems}
\end{itemize}
