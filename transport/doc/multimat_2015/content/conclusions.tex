In conclusion, the FCT scheme presented guarantees
a non-negative solution that satisfies a discrete maximum principle.
While this FCT scheme does not guarantee monotonicity, it has been
found to be successful in many simple test problems. The underlying
high-order scheme based on entropy viscosity has been found to
produce a higher quality FCT solution than using an inviscid
high-order scheme. A number of challenges remain - for example,
FCT transients can give rise to spurious plateaus and can have non-monotone
solutions within the bounds of the imposed discrete maximum principle.
These unphysical effects arise due to unphysical oscillations in the
high-order solution; improving the high-order solution improves
the quality of the FCT scheme.

Future work will extend this scheme to implicit time
discretizations since the CFL condition required by explicit time
discretizations can be very restrictive, particularly for radiation transport simulations.
In addition, many problems of interest involve steady-state solutions
of the transport equation, so a steady-state FCT scheme will also be
a subject of future work.
