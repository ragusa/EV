\section*{6-22-2015}

The following goals were outlined for the next meeting:
\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Obtain multidimensional results for explicit FCT}.
In progress.

\item \textbf{Compare symmetric limiter with upwind limiter}.
The symmetric limiting coefficients have the following definition:
\begin{equation}
  L\ij = \left\{\begin{array}{l l}
    \min\{R_i^+,R_j^-\}, & F\ij > 0 \\
    \min\{R_i^-,R_j^+\}, & F\ij < 0
  \end{array}\right.,
\end{equation}
while the upwind-biased limiting coefficients have the following definition:
\begin{equation}
  L\ij = \left\{\begin{array}{l l}
    R_k^+, & F\ij > 0 \\
    R_k^-, & F\ij < 0
  \end{array}\right.,
\end{equation}
where $k$ is the upwind node of $i$ and $j$. It is noted here that, unlike
the symmetric limiting coefficients, the upwind-biased limiting coefficients
do not necessarily satisfy the discrete maximum principle. This is disproved
here by a counterexample. Recall that the discrete maximum principle is satisfied when
$Q_i^-\le \sum_j L\ij F\ij\le Q_i^+$. Suppose a node $i$ has a single
neighboring node $i-1$, and that this neighbor is upwind of $i$. For example, this is
the case for a 1-D domain on the outflow boundary. Thus there is a single
correction flux $F_{i,i-1}$: $\sum_j L\ij F\ij=L_{i,i-1} F_{i,i-1}$. Now
suppose that without limitation, this correction flux would exceed the
upper bound $Q_i^+$, i.e., $F_{i,i-1}>Q_i^+$. Suppose further that
$P_{i-1}^+\leq Q_{i-1}^+$. Then,
\[
  \sum\limits_j L\ij F\ij=
  L_{i,i-1} F_{i,i-1}=
  R_{i-1}^+ F_{i,i-1}=
  \min\left\{1,\frac{Q_{i-1}^+}{P_{i-1}^+}\right\} F_{i,i-1}=
  F_{i,i-1}>
  Q_i^+,
\]
which violates the DMP condition.

\item \textbf{Determine if converged steady-state results match transient results}.
In progress.

\item \textbf{Determine how to evaluate analytic DMP bounds in multidimensional problems}.
In progress.
  \item \textbf{Compare time step size computed from $1-\frac{\dt}{m_i}A^L_{i,i}$ to
        that obtained by examining the eigenvalues of $(\M^L)^{-1}\A^L$}.
        In progress.
  \item \textbf{In the source-void-to-absorber problem, ramp the source from zero instead of
        instantaneously adding the source}.
        In progress.
  \item \textbf{Determine if Kuzmin's implicit bounds are equal to our implicit bounds}.
        In progress.
  \item \textbf{Evaluate the benefit of Kuzmin's ``prelimiting'' step}.
        In progress.
\end{enumerate}

The following suggestions were made:
\begin{itemize}
  \item archive all results found, with code version number and descriptions of run parameters
  \item create a test suite to determine if code updates break the code
\end{itemize}
