\section*{6-22-2015}
The following items were requested for the next meeting:
\begin{itemize}
  \item obtain multidimensional results for explicit FCT
  \item compare symmetric limiter with upwind limiter
  \item determine if converged steady-state results match transient results
  \item determine how to evaluate analytic DMP bounds in multidimensional problems
  \item compare time step size computed from $1-\frac{\dt}{m_i}A^L_{i,i}$ to
    that obtained by examining the eigenvalues of $(\M^L)^{-1}\A^L$
  \item in the void-to-absorber problem, ramp the source from zero instead of
    instantaneously adding the source
  \item determine if Kuzmin's implicit bounds are equal to our implicit bounds
\end{itemize}

The following suggestions were made:
\begin{itemize}
  \item archive all results found, with code version number and descriptions of run parameters
  \item create a test suite to determine if code updates break the code
\end{itemize}
