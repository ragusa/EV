This directory contains files used in a test to try a new FCT limitation
technique. This technique does not use a DMP for solution bounds but
instead chooses the limiting coefficient to minimize entropy production.
Specifically the goal of this limiter is

minimize f(x) subject to the constraints:
0 <= L_edge <= 1 , for all edges

where f(x) is the sum of the following integrals of entropy:

f_i(x) = \int\limits_{S_i} \phi_i(x) \eta(u(x)) dV ,

where \eta(u(x)) is the entropy function. This amounts to a nonlinear
optimization problem with linear inequality constraints. This optimization
problem is solved by MATLAB's fmincon() function.

It was found that this approach gives the low-order solution, so this
approach was abandoned.
