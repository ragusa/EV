This section is organized as follows: Section \ref{sec:model_equations_intro}
introduces the model equations considered in this dissertation,
Section \ref{sec:positive_transport} reviews previous work on
obtaining non-negative transport solutions, and
Section \ref{sec:hyperbolic_intro} reviews previous work on the
solution of hyperbolic conservation laws, which includes an
introduction to entropy viscosity and FCT.
