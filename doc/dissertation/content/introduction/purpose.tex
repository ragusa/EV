The solution of conservation law equations such as the neutron transport
equation presents a number of unique challenges; in the vicinity of strong
gradients and discontinuities, numerical solutions are prone to spurious
oscillations that may generate unphysical values. For example, physically
non-negative quantities such as scalar flux or angular flux may have negative
numerical solution values if care is not taken in the numerical scheme.
These negativities are not only undesirable because they are physically
incorrect, but also because often numerical algorithms completely break
down, causing simulations to abort, or worse, altering results without
discovery that unphysical values were encountered. The consequences of
these results may lead to poor design choices, which can pose serious safety
risks when a design is implemented.

These issues of spurious oscillations and negativities are a well-known
phenomenon in the simulation of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs),
for example, linear advection, Burger's equation, the inviscid Euler equations
of gas dynamics, and the shallow water (or Saint-Venant) equations.
These PDEs result from manipulating the corresponding integral
conservation law equations; however, these manipulations are only valid when
the solution is smooth - in the presence of shocks, the PDE form breaks down
\cite{leveque2002}\refsec{11.6}. Thus it becomes necessary to work with
these equations in a weak form, which holds in the presence of shocks.
However, the mathematical formulations for these problems
do not necessarily yield unique weak solutions; this is a manifestation of the
neglect of physics in the underlying hyperbolic PDE model
\cite{leveque2002}\refsec{11.13}.

Attempts to address these issues have taken a number
of different approaches for different discretization schemes.

To produce a unique, physically meaningful solution, it is necessary to
enforce additional conditions, often called \emph{admissibility conditions}
or \emph{entropy conditions}, which filter out spurious weak solutions,
leaving only the physical, \emph{entropy-satisfying} weak solution
\cite{leveque2002}\refsec{11.13}.
There are a number of entropy conditions that may be applied: some
examples are the Lax entropy condition and the Oleinik entropy
condition\cite{leveque2002}\refsec{11.13}; however, it can be impractical
to apply these conditions in a numerical simulation. The research in this
dissertation employs the notion of an entropy-based artificial viscosity,
based on the recent work of Guermond et al.\cite{guermond_ev}.
The notion of entropy stems from
thermodynamics, in which entropy is a non-decreasing function of time.
