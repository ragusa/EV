In this section, the solution bounds discussed in Section \ref{sec:fct_bounds}
will be translated into bounds on the antidiffusive fluxes defined in
Section \ref{sec:fct_scheme_scalar}. These antidiffusion bounds, along
with the antidiffusive fluxes, are the input to the limiter (described
in Section \ref{sec:limiting_coefficients_scalar}), which computes
the limiting coefficient associated with each antidiffusive flux.
This section is organized as follows. Section \ref{sec:antidiffusion_bounds_def}
gives the definition of the antidiffusive bounds, derived from the
imposed solution bounds, and Section \ref{sec:antidiffusion_bounds_signs}
discusses some requirements on these bounds.
