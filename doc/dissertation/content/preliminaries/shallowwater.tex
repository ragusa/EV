The shallow water equations, also known as the Saint-Venant equations, are an
approximation of conservation of mass and momentum equations applied to free
surface flows, which assume the fluid to be incompressible, non-viscous, and
non-heat-conducting. The shallow water equations make the additional
approximation that the depth component of acceleration can be neglected due to
horizontal length scales being much greater than the depth length
scale and then depth-integrate the conservation equations to obtain
the following\cite{toro2009}\cite{leveque2002}:
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
  \ppt{\vectorsolution} + \nabla\cdot\consfluxvector
  = \conssource \eqc
\\
  \vectorsolution
    = \left[\begin{array}{c}
        \height\\
        \heightmomentumx\\
        \heightmomentumy
      \end{array}\right]
  \eqc\quad
  \consfluxvector
  = \left[\begin{array}{c c}
      \heightmomentumx & \heightmomentumy\\
      \frac{\heightmomentumx^2}{\height} + \half\gravity\height^2
        & \frac{\heightmomentumx\heightmomentumy}{\height}\\
      \frac{\heightmomentumx\heightmomentumy}{\height}
        & \frac{\heightmomentumy^2}{\height} + \half\gravity\height^2\\
    \end{array}\right]
  \eqc\quad
  \conssource
  = \left[\begin{array}{c}
      0\\
     -\gravity\height\pd{\bathymetry}{x}\\
     -\gravity\height\pd{\bathymetry}{y}\\
    \end{array}\right]
  \eqc
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}
written more concisely as
\[
  \vectorsolution
    = \left[\begin{array}{c}\height\\\heightmomentum\end{array}\right]
  \eqc\quad
  \consfluxvector
  = \left[\begin{array}{c}\heightmomentum\\
      \frac{\heightmomentum\otimes\heightmomentum}{\height}
      + \half\gravity\height^2\identity
    \end{array}\right]
  \eqc\quad
  \conssource
  = \left[\begin{array}{c}0\\-\gravity\height\nabla\bathymetry\end{array}
    \right] \eqc
\]
where $\height$ is the height of the water, which plays the role of density
in the continuity equation, $\heightmomentum=\height\velocity$ is sometimes
referred to as \emph{discharge} and plays the role of momentum and so will
here just be referred to as ``momentum'', $\velocity$ is velocity, $\gravity$
is acceleration due to gravity, and $\bathymetry$ is the topography of the
bottom of the fluid body with respect to some reference point.

Note that the shallow water equations are only valid in 1-D or 2-D, not 3-D,
since they are depth-integrated equations.
