The primary application of this research is radiation transport,
as given by Equation \eqref{eq:rad_transport};
however, most of the analysis performed is valid
for any scalar conservation law of the following form:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:scalar_transport}
   \ppt{\scalarsolution} + \divergence\consfluxscalar
   + \reactioncoef\xt \scalarsolution\xt = \scalarsource\xt \eqc
\end{equation}
where $\scalarsolution\xt$ is a general scalar conserved quantity at position
$\x$ and time $\timevalue$, $\consfluxscalar$ is a general flux
function,
$\reactioncoef \xt\geq 0$ is a reaction coefficient, and $\scalarsource\xt \geq 0$ is a source
term.
Note that traditional FCT methodology does not consider the
the presence of the reaction term $\reactioncoef\xt \scalarsolution\xt$
or source term $\scalarsource\xt$ \cite{kuzmin_FCT}; extension to include these
terms is a significant driver for this research since this allows the application
of FCT to radiation transport, for example.
Since the radiation transport equation has a linear flux function
$\consfluxscalar$, hereafter it is assumed that
$\consfluxscalar\equiv\velocity\scalarsolution$, where $\velocity$ is a constant
velocity.

The radiation transport equation given by Equation
\eqref{eq:rad_transport} fits the model of
Equation \eqref{eq:scalar_transport}
by making the following substitutions:
\[
  \scalarsolution\rightarrow\angularflux
  \eqc \quad
  \velocity\rightarrow\speed\directionvector
  \eqc \quad
  \reactioncoef\rightarrow\speed\totalcrosssection
  \eqc \quad
  \scalarsource\rightarrow\speed\radiationsource
  \eqc
\]

Initial conditions are included if the problem is transient:
\begin{equation}
   \scalarsolution(\x,0) = \scalarsolution^0(\x)
   \quad \forall \x\in\domain \eqp
\end{equation}
Boundary conditions will depend on the chosen conservation law and
the particular problem. 
This research assumes an incoming flux boundary condition:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:incoming_flux}
   \scalarsolution\xt = \scalarsolution^{\text{inc}}\xt \quad \forall \x
   \in \domainboundary^-,
     \quad \domainboundary^- = \{\x\in\domainboundary:
     \velocity\cdot\normalvector(\x)<0\} \eqp
\end{equation}
These conditions together make the problem well-posed, but for general
nonlinear conservation laws, care must be taken to ensure that the
boundary conditions used result in a well-posed problem.

Some options for the implementation of the incoming flux boundary condition
are presented in Section \ref{sec:transport_bc}.
