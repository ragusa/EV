\chapter{DERIVATION OF THE MAX WAVE SPEED FOR THE SHALLOW WATER EQUATIONS}
\label{app:shallow_water_max_wave_speed}}

The maximum wave speed is the maximum of the absolute values of the
left-most and right-most waves:
\begin{equation}
  \maxwavespeed(\vectorsolution_L, \vectorsolution_R)
  = \max(|\wavespeed_1^-|,|\wavespeed_2^+|)
  \eqc
\end{equation}
where the ``+'' and ``-'' allow for the differentiation of the head
and tail speeds in the case of a rarefaction.

For the 1-D shallow water equations, the Riemann problem divides the
$(x-\timevalue)$ plane into 3 sectors
