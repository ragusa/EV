This section describes a low-order scheme for \emph{systems}
of conservation laws since the scalar methodology described in Section
\ref{sec:low_order_scalar} no longer applies. The low-order
scheme is adapted from recent work by Guermond \cite{guermond_invariantdomain},
which focuses on a property called \emph{domain-invariance},
which is described in Section \ref{sec:invariant_domains}. Section
\ref{sec:low_order_scheme_system} summarizes the low-order system.
In contrast to the scalar case, only explicit Euler and SSPRK time
discretizations are considered for the system case.
