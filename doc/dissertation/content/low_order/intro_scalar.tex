In this section, a first-order, positivity-preserving scheme for
scalar conservation laws will be described. This scheme is adapted from
Guermond \cite{guermond_firstorder}, in which a general scalar conservation
law of the form
\begin{equation}
  \ppt{\scalarsolution} + \divergence\consfluxscalar = 0 \eqc
\end{equation}
is considered; this section additionally considers the presence of a
reaction term and source term as given by Equation \eqref{eq:scalar_transport}.
This scheme will be shown to preserve non-negativity of the solution and
to satisfy a local discrete maximum principle (DMP). DMP-satisfaction
is a key property in the prevention of spurious oscillations.

This section is organized as follows: Section \ref{sec:low_order_viscosity_scalar}
makes some definitions that are necessary to define the low-order scheme, including
a low-order artificial viscosity and a local graph-theoretic viscous bilinear form.
Section \ref{sec:low_order_scheme_scalar} defines the low-order system in a number
of temporal discretizations. Section \ref{sec:m_matrix} gives a theoretical proof that the
definitions of the low-order scheme yield an inverse-positive system matrix,
thus proving positivity-preservation. Finally, Section \ref{sec:DMP} lists and
proves local DMPs for each considered temporal discretization.
