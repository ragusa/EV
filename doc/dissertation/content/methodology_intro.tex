This chapter is organized as follows. Section \ref{sec:model_equations} gives
the model equations considered in this research, Section \ref{sec:discretization}
describes the spatial and temporal discretizations used in this research,
Section \ref{sec:low_order_scalar} describes a first-order scheme for scalar
conservation laws that is positivity-preserving and discrete maximum principle-
preserving, Section \ref{sec:low_order_system} describes a first-order scheme
for conservation law systems that is positivity-preserving and domain-invariant,
Section \ref{sec:high_order_scalar} describes a high-order entropy-based
scheme for scalar conservation laws, Section \ref{sec:high_order_system}
describes a high-order entropy-based scheme for conservation law systems,
Sections \ref{sec:fct_scalar} and \ref{sec:fct_systems} describe flux-corrected
transport (FCT) schemes for scalar conservation laws and conservation law
systems, respectively, and Section \ref{sec:implementation} gives some implementation
details.
