In this section, the entropy viscosity method introduced by Guermond
\cite{guermond_ev}\cite{guermond_secondorder} is extended to the shallow
water equations.
Section \ref{sec:entropy_viscosity_system} defines the entropy viscosity
for the shallow water equations, and Section \ref{sec:high_order_scheme_system}
summarizes the high-order system for explicit Euler (and thus SSPRK)
time discretizations.
