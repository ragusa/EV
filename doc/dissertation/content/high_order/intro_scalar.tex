In this section, the entropy viscosity method introduced by Guermond
\cite{guermond_ev}\cite{guermond_secondorder} is extended to the scalar
transport model given by Equation \eqref{eq:scalar_transport}.
Section \ref{sec:entropy_viscosity_scalar} defines the entropy viscosity
for the scalar transport model, and Section \ref{sec:high_order_scheme_scalar}
summarizes the high-order system for each of the time discretizations
considered in this dissertation.
