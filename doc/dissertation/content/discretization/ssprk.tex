Strong Stability-Preserving Runge Kutta (SSPRK) methods are a class of multistage
Runge Kutta methods that offer high-order accuracy while preserving stability.
The subset of SSPRK methods considered in this research conform to the
following form for a given time step $t^n\rightarrow t^{n+1}$,
where $\hat{\U}^i$ denotes the $i$th stage solution:
\begin{equation}
   \hat{\U}^i = \alpha_i\hat{\U}^0
%   + \beta_i\,\mbox{step}(\hat{\U}^{i-1},t^n+c_i\Delta t),
   + \beta_i\tilde{\U}^i \eqc
\end{equation}
where $\Delta t=t^{n+1}-t^n$, $\hat{\U}^0=\U^n$,
and $\tilde{\U}^i$ is the solution of the following forward Euler
step:
\begin{equation}
   \M\tilde{\U}^i = \M\hat{\U}^{i-1}
   + \Delta t(\b(t_i) - \A(t_i)\hat{\U}^{i-1}) \eqc
\end{equation}
where $t_i = t^n+c_i\Delta t$,
$\M$ is the mass matrix, $\b(t)$ is the steady-state
right hand side vector, and $\A(t)$ is the steady-state matrix.
Therefore the function performs a time step that is similar to an
explicit Euler step, except that the steady-state residual is not
necessarily evaluated at time $t^n$. The new solution $\U^{n+1}$
is the final stage solution:
\begin{equation}
   \U^{n+1} = \hat{\U}^s,
\end{equation}
where $s$ is the number of stages for the scheme.

The Explicit Euler scheme can be expressed as a 1-stage SSPRK method with
with the following coefficients:
\begin{equation}
   \alpha_1 = 0\qquad\beta_1 = 1\qquad c_1 = 0,
\end{equation}
and the 3-stage, 3rd-order accurate SSPRK scheme (also known as the Shu-Osher
scheme), has the following coefficients:
\begin{equation}
   \alpha = \left[\begin{array}{c}0\\\frac{3}{4}\\\frac{1}{3}\end{array}\right]
   \qquad\beta = \left[\begin{array}{c}1\\\frac{1}{4}\\\frac{2}{3}\end{array}\right]
   \qquad c = \left[\begin{array}{c}0\\1\\\frac{1}{2}\end{array}\right].
\end{equation}
