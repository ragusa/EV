This research investigated a number of different numerical methods for
the solution of hyperbolic PDEs with the continuous finite element
method.

A first-order, positivity-preserving, DMP-satisfying method
for scalar hyperbolic PDEs, recently developed by Guermond and Nazarov
\cite{guermond_firstorder} for scalar hyperbolic PDEs, was extended
to hyperbolic PDEs including a reaction term and extraneous source term.

A first-order, positivity-preserving, and domain-invariant method for systems
of hyperbolic PDEs, recently developed by Guermond and Popov
\cite{guermond_invariantdomain} for systems of hyperbolic PDEs,
has been applied to the shallow water equations with flat bottom topography.

The entropy viscosity method developed by Guermond and others \cite{guermond_ev}
was applied to scalar transport and the shallow water equations, with flat
or non-flat bottom topography. Results show that addition of this entropy-based
artificial dissipation results in convergence to the entropy solution
and reduces the onset of spurious oscillations but in general does not eliminate
them completely, and thus the entropy viscosity method is not immune to
solution negativities.
