In this section, a class of test problems is described that use a unit
hypercube $(0,1)^d$ as the domain, where $d$ is the number of
spatial dimensions. The hypercube has a number $N_r$ of uniform regions
in which the source $q$ and reaction cross section $\sigma$ are
constant. Thus each of the test problems that fit in this
category can be fully described by:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the positions of the interfaces between the regions,
    $[r_1,\ldots,r_{N_r-1}]$ (the positions $r_0$ and $r_{N_r}$
    refer to the hypercube boundaries 0 and 1, respectively),
  \item the source strengths in each region, $q_0,\ldots,q_{N_r-1}$:
    $q(\x) = q_i,\qquad $
  \item the cross sections in each region, $\sigma_0,\ldots,\sigma_{N_r-1}$,
\end{itemize}

The exact solution is the following:
\[
  u(\x,t) = u_b + u_q \eqc
\]
where
\[
  u_b=\tilde{u_0}(x-ct)e^{-\tau} \eqc
        \quad N_r=3\eqc\quad
        \tau = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{N_r-1} \sigma_i s_i \eqc
\]
\[
  \tilde{u_0}(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l l}
        u_{inc}, & x<x_0\\
        0,       & x\geq 0
     \end{array}\right. \eqc
\]
\[
  u_q=\sum\limits_{i=0}^{N_r-1}u_{q,i}e^{-\tau_i},\quad
        \tau_i = \sum\limits_{j=i+1}^{N_r-1} \sigma_j s_j \eqc
\]
\[
  u_{q,i} = \left\{\begin{array}{l l}
        \frac{q_i}{\sigma_i}\left(1-e^{-\sigma_i s_i}\right), & \sigma_i\neq 0\\
        q_i s_i, & \sigma_i = 0
        \end{array}\right. \eqp
\]
