This section presents the results for scalar transport.
For transient simulations, the time step size used is given as a
``CFL'' number $\nu$, which is defined in terms of the maximum
time step size for Explicit Euler time discretization of the
low-order scheme, given by Equation \eqref{eq:explicit_cfl}:
\begin{equation}
  \nu \equiv \frac{\dt}{\dt_{\textup{CFL}}} \eqc \quad
  \dt_{\textup{CFL}} \equiv \min\limits_i
    \frac{\massmatrixletter_{i,i}^{L}}{\ssmatrixletter_{i,i}^{L,n}}
  \eqp
\end{equation}
Note that the time step size for the Theta method is less
restrictive for $\theta > 0$ (see Equation \eqref{eq:theta_cfl});
however, for Theta method results, the definition of $\nu$ above is
still used.
