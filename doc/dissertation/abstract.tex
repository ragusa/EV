The Flux-Corrected Transport (FCT) algorithm in conjunction with the
entropy viscosity method was applied to scalar radiation transport and
the shallow water equations with the continuous finite element method.
For smooth problems, second-order spatial accuracy is achieved if adequate
solution bounds are used in the FCT algorithm. The resulting scheme is
positivity-preserving and reduces the onset of spurious oscillations.
Explicit SSPRK time discretizations are considered for both scalar
radiation transport and the shallow water equations, and additionally
for scalar radiation transport, $\theta$ time discretizations and
steady-state are considered. Implicit FCT is shown to have significant
convergence issues.
