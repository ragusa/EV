The Flux-Corrected Transport (FCT) algorithm, in conjunction with the
entropy viscosity method, was applied with the continuous finite element method
to (a) a scalar transport equation that includes reaction and source terms and
(b) the shallow water equations.
For smooth problems, second-order spatial accuracy is achieved if adequate
solution bounds are used in the FCT algorithm. The resulting scheme is
positivity-preserving and reduces the onset of spurious oscillations.
Explicit SSPRK time discretizations are considered for both scalar
transport and the shallow water equations, and additionally
for scalar transport, $\theta$ time discretizations and
steady-state are considered. Explicit FCT schemes are shown to
be relatively robust; positivity preservation is guaranteed and spurious
oscillations are reduced, if not eliminated entirely.
Implicit/steady-state FCT schemes, however, are shown to have
significant nonlinear convergence issues in many cases, as is noted by
Kuzmin \cite{kuzmin_FCT}.
