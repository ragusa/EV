  Abstract                 = {The tsunami generated by the Great East Japan Earthquake caused serious damage to the coastal areas of the Tohoku district. Numerical simulations are used to predict damage caused by tsunamis. Shallow-water equations are generally used in numerical simulations of tsunami propagation from the open sea to the coast. This research focuses on viscous shallow-water equations and attempts to generate a computational method using finite element techniques based on the previous investigations of Kanayama and Ohtsuka (Coast Eng Jpn 21:157--171, 1978). First, the viscous shallow-water equation system is derived from the Navier--Stokes equations, based on the assumption of hydrostatic pressure in the direction of gravity. Next a numerical scheme is shown. Finally, tsunami simulations of Hakata Bay and Tohoku-Oki are shown using the approach.},
