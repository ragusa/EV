First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Jean Ragusa,

with us to develop effective numerical methods for conservation laws.
I would also like to thank Dr. Bojan Popov for his input in these
fruitful discussions.

I would like to thank all of those who have contributed to the
development of the \texttt{deal.II} finite element library, which has been
a tremendous help in the implementation of the methods given in this
dissertation. I would especially like to thank Drs. Wolfgang Bangerth
and Bruno Turcksin, who have quickly answered many questions I had regarding
the use of \texttt{deal.II}.

I would like to thank all of those who have contributed to the development
of FCT methods over the years, whose works I have thoroughly read in
preparation for this research. I would like to thank Dr. Dmitri Kuzmin
for his responses in my questions about FCT.

\hl{NOTE: Is this where the following should go? Can it be better worded?}
I would lastly like to thank those who funded this research;
this research was funded by an NEUP (Nuclear Energy University Programs)
fellowship from the U.S. Department of Energy and also by the \texttt{MOOSE}
