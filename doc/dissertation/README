=====================
* eliminate newcommands.tex in favor of newestcommands.tex; this entails
  substituting commands defined in newcommands.tex with the equivalent
  commands in newestcommands.tex
* use the commands defined in newestcommands.tex universally
* eliminate all Overfull hbox warnings: these should be marked with black bars
  in the margins
* check that all equation references use \eqref instead of \ref
* use identifiers for each type of reference, e.g., for tables,
  \ref{tab:mytablename}
* consistently use or do not use equivalence sign (3-bar "=" sign)
* check that either of these is consistent throughout the dissertation:
  1. only important equations are numbered
  2. all equations are numbered
