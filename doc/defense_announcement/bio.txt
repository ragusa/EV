Joshua has been a student in Texas A\&M's Nuclear Engineering
Department for almost 9 years, receiving his Bachelor of Science in 2011
and his Master of Science in 2013.
Joshua started research for Dr. Ragusa as an undergraduate, writing
a Senior Scholar's thesis on Rosenbrock time discretization methods,
and continued with Ragusa as a Master's student, writing a
Master's thesis on solution techniques for single-phase subchannel
equations. His present dissertation work aims to eliminate
negativities and spurious oscillations that arise in the solution
of hyperbolic conservation laws with the continuous finite element
method. After graduation, Joshua plans to obtain a postdoctoral
or staff position in computational physics at one of the national laboratories.
