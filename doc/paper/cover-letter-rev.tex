Please find attached a revised copy of our manuscript titled ``Flux-Corrected Transport Techniques Applied to the Radiation Transport Equation Discretized with Continuous Finite Elements'' for consideration in the {\em Journal of Computational Physics}. 

We thank the Reviewer for their comments and thorough review. We have addressed their comments, summarized in the Response to Reviewers letter.  A new PDF file of the manuscript has been created to highlight all of the changes made to the original manuscript. 

We believe that we have adequately addressed all of the Reviewer's questions and hope that our paper will be found suitable for publication.

We remain available for any further questions, should there be any.


Note that the JCP submission system uses all of our uploaded latex files, so you may see the {\bf revised manuscript twice}: once without any markups and once showing the markups between the current version and the first submission.
