\begin{itemize}
\item applications of transport equation
\begin{itemize}
\item reactors, medical, astrophys, HEDP (high energy density physics ....)
\item  in this paper, we focus on solution techniques applicable to the first-order form of the TE discretized with DO (Sn) in angle. Sn because it decouples directions when using iteration techniques for scattering source (references DO, SI)
\item usually, Sn transport people use DG (Lessaint/Raviart 1972, Reed/Hill 1973). Here, we opted for CFEM: (1) proof of concept of FCT-CFEM for transport abundant lit on this (Kuzmin), (2) recent work by JLG/Po on stabilization technique for conserva laws used CFEM, (3) once demonstrated, there are ways to pass to DG (Zingan LO, EV ingredients are there, FCT-DG  FCT algebraic ???)
\end{itemize}

\item previous work on positivity-preservation
\begin{itemize}
\item transport community: fix-ups, Maginots CSZ, BCSZ, Warsa LANL, 
\item 
\item 
\end{itemize}
\item FCT: hydro, old idea, new spin algebraic FCT Kuzmin. DMP. What is FCT: Lo/HO. novelty: HO -> EV
\item entropy viscosity.
\item a lot of FCT out there is EXPLICIT. in radiation transport, SS, Impl. new and needs to be investigated
\item emphasis transport = advection + reaction + source term. new as well in FCT world.
