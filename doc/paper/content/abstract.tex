The entropy viscosity method introduced by Guermond \cite{guermond_ev},
in conjunction with the Flux-Corrected Transport (FCT) algorithm, is
applied to the transport equation using the continuous finite element
method. The resulting scheme is second-order accurate in space,
enforces an entropy inequality, mitigates the formation of spurious
oscillations, and guarantees the absence of negativities.
Time discretizations considered include steady-state, Theta methods
such as explicit and implicit Euler, and strong-stability preserving
Runge-Kutta (SSPRK) methods.
The developed scheme is shown to be robust with explicit time discretizations
but encounters significant nonlinear convergence difficulties for steady-state
and implicit time discretizations.
