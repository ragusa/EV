\tcr{I think it is a bit too detailed, and doesn't give the main punchline. 
1) We derived FCT for particle transport
2) it uses a low-order positivity preserving scheme (based on M-matrix properties)
3) we use a high-order scheme that is EV
4) the 3 above points are the novelty of the papers
Then you can give some details}
The entropy viscosity method introduced by Guermond \cite{guermond_ev},
in conjunction with the Flux-Corrected Transport (FCT) algorithm, is
applied to the transport equation using the continuous finite element
method. The resulting scheme is second-order accurate in space,
enforces an entropy inequality, mitigates the formation of spurious
oscillations, and guarantees the absence of negativities.
Time discretizations considered include steady-state, Theta methods
such as explicit and implicit Euler, and strong-stability preserving
Runge-Kutta (SSPRK) methods.
The developed scheme is shown to be robust with explicit time discretizations
but encounters significant nonlinear convergence difficulties for steady-state
and implicit time discretizations.
