The Flux-Corrected Transport (FCT) algorithm is
applied to the unsteady and steady-state particle transport equation. The proposed FCT method employs the following:
(1) a low-order, positivity-preserving scheme,
based on the application of M-matrix properties,
(2) a high-order scheme based on the entropy viscosity method introduced by
Guermond \cite{guermond_ev}, and
(3) local, discrete solution bounds derived from the integral transport equation.
The resulting scheme is second-order accurate in space,
enforces an entropy inequality, mitigates the formation of spurious
oscillations, and guarantees the absence of negativities.
Space discretization is achieved using  continuous finite elements. 
Time discretizations for unsteady problems include theta schemes
such as explicit and implicit Euler, and strong-stability preserving
Runge-Kutta (SSPRK) methods.
The developed scheme is shown to be robust with explicit time discretizations
but encounters nonlinear convergence difficulties for steady-state
and implicit time discretizations.
