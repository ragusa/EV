The Flux-Corrected Transport (FCT) algorithm is
applied to the transport equation using the continuous finite element
method. In addition to this novelty,
a number of components of this FCT algorithm are themselves novelties
for the transport equation:
1) a low-order, positivity-preserving scheme,
based on the application of M-matrix properties,
2) a high-order scheme based on the entropy viscosity method introduced by
Guermond \cite{guermond_ev}, and
3) local, discrete solution bounds derived from the integral transport equation.
The resulting scheme is second-order accurate in space,
enforces an entropy inequality, mitigates the formation of spurious
oscillations, and guarantees the absence of negativities.
Time discretizations considered include steady-state, Theta methods
such as explicit and implicit Euler, and strong-stability preserving
Runge-Kutta (SSPRK) methods.
The developed scheme is shown to be robust with explicit time discretizations
but encounters significant nonlinear convergence difficulties for steady-state
and implicit time discretizations.
