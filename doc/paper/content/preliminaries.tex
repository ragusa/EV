For the remainder of this paper, the scalar transport model given by
Equation~\eqref{eq:transport_scalar} will be generalized to a scalar
balance equation having reaction terms and source terms, with the following
notation:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:scalar_model}
  \ppt{u} + v\di\cdot\nabla u\xt
    + \sigma(\x) u\xt = q\xt
  \eqc
\end{equation}
where $u$ is the balanced quantity, $v$ is the transport speed, $\di$ is
a constant, uniform unit direction vector, $\sigma$ is the reaction coefficient,
and $q$ is the source function. Note that $q \ge 0$ for particle transport: the
external source, the inscattering source, and the fission source are all particle
production terms and hence are positive. 

The problem formulation is completed by supplying initial conditions on the
problem domain $\domain$ (for transient problems):
\begin{equation}
  u(\x,0) = u^0(\x) \quad \x\in\domain \eqc
\end{equation}
as well as boundary conditions,
which will be assumed to be incoming flux boundary conditions:
\begin{equation}
  u\xt = \incoming\xt \quad \x\in\partial\domain^- \eqc
\end{equation}
where $\incoming\xt$ is the incoming boundary data function, and
$\partial\domain^-$ is the incoming portion of the domain boundary:
\begin{equation}
  \partial\domain^- \equiv \{ \x\in\partial\domain :
  \normalvector(\x)\cdot\di \leq 0 \} \eqc
\end{equation}
where $\normalvector(\x)$ is the outward-pointing normal vector on the domain
boundary at point $\x$.

Application of the standard Galerkin method with piecewise linear basis functions
gives the following semi-discrete system:
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:galerkin_semidiscrete}
  \begin{equation}
    \M^C\ddt{\U} + \A\U(t) = \ssrhs(t) \eqc
  \end{equation}
where the consistent (i.e., not lumped) mass matrix is given by
  \begin{equation}
    M^C_{i,j} \equiv \intSij \test_i(\x)\test_j(\x) dV \eqc
  \end{equation}
the (steady-tstate) transport matrix is  
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:Aij}
    A_{i,j} \equiv \intSij\left(
    v\di\cdot\nabla\test_j(\x) +
    \sigma(\x)\test_j(\x)\right)\test_i(\x) dV \eqc
  \end{equation}
and the right-hand-side is
  \begin{equation}
    b_i(t) \equiv \intSi q(\x)\test_i(\x) dV \eqp
  \end{equation}
\end{subequations}
The components of the solution vector $\U(t)$ are denoted by $U_j(t)$ and represent
the degrees of freedom of the approximate solution $u_h$:
\begin{equation}
  u_h\xt = \sumj U_j(t) \test_j(\x) \eqc
\end{equation}
where $\test_j(\x)$ is a finite element test function.
$S_i$ is the support of basis function $i$ and $S_{i,j}$
is the shared support of basis functions $i$ and $j$.

A number of temporal discretizations are considered in this paper.
Fully explicit temporal discretizations considered include forward Euler:
\begin{equation}
  \M^C\frac{\U^{n+1}-\U^n}{\dt} + \A\U^n = \ssrhs^n \eqc
\end{equation}
as well as Strong Stability Preserving Runge Kutta (SSPRK) methods that
can be expressed in the following form:
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:ssprk}
\begin{align}
  & \hat{\U}^0 = \U^n \eqc \\
  & \hat{\U}^i = \gamma_i \U^n + \zeta_i \left[
      \hat{\U}^{i-1}
      + \dt\mathbf{G}(t^n+c_i\dt, \hat{\U}^{i-1})\right]
    \eqc \quad
    i = 1,\ldots,s
    \eqc \\
  & \U^{n+1} = \hat{\U}^s \eqp
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $s$ is the number of stages, $\gamma_i$, $\zeta_i$, and $c_i$ are
coefficients that correspond to the particular SSPRK method, and
$\mathbf{G}$ represents the right-hand-side function of an ODE
\begin{equation}
  \ddt{\U} = \mathbf{G}(t,\U(t)) \eqc
\end{equation}
which in this case is the following:
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{G}(t,\U(t)) = (\M^C)^{-1}
    \left(\ssrhs(t) - \A\U(t)\right) \eqp
\end{equation}
SSPRK methods are a subclass of Runge Kutta methods that offer high-order
accuracy while preserving stability \cite{gottlieb}\cite{macdonald}.
The form given in Equation \eqref{eq:ssprk} makes it clear that these
SSPRK methods can be expressed as a linear combination of steps resembling
forward Euler steps, with the only difference being that the explicit
time dependence of the source is not necessarily on the old time $t^n$ but
instead is on a stage time $t^n + c_i\dt$.
An example is the 3-stage, 3rd-order accurate SSPRK
method has the following coefficients:
\begin{equation}
  \gamma = \left[\begin{array}{c}
    0\\\frac{3}{4}\\\frac{1}{3}\end{array}\right]
  \eqc \quad
  \zeta = \left[\begin{array}{c}
    1\\\frac{1}{4}\\\frac{2}{3}\end{array}\right]
  \eqc \quad
  c = \left[\begin{array}{c}0\\1\\\frac{1}{2}\end{array}\right] \eqp
\end{equation}

This work also considers the Theta-family of temporal discretizations:
\begin{equation}
  \M^C\frac{\U^{n+1}-\U^n}{\dt} + \A((1-\theta)\U^n + \theta\U^{n+1})
  = (1-\theta)\ssrhs^n + \theta\ssrhs^{n+1} \eqc
\end{equation}
where $0\leq\theta\leq 1$ is the implicitness parameter. For example,
$\theta$ values of $0$, $\frac{1}{2}$, and $1$ correspond to forward Euler,
Crank-Nicohlson, and backward Euler discretizations, respectively.

Finally, in the case of a steady-state solve, we have the following system of equations:
\begin{equation}
  \A\U = \ssrhs \eqp
\end{equation}
