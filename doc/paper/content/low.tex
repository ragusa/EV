The role of a low-order scheme in the context of the FCT algorithm is to
provide a fail-safe solution, which has desirable properties such as
positivity-preservation and lack of spurious oscillations. These properties
come at the cost of excessive artificial diffusion and thus a lesser degree
of accuracy. However, the idea of the FCT algorithm is to undo some of the over-dissipation 
of the low-order scheme as much as possible without violating some physically-motivated solution bounds.

Here positivity-preservation and monotonicity are achieved by 
requiring that that the matrix of the low-order system satisfies the M-matrix property.
%satisfying
% the M-matrix property of the matrix inverted in the low-order system.
M-matrices are a subset of inverse-positive matrices and have the monotone
property. For instance, consider the linear system $\A\x = \ssrhs$;
If $\A$ is an M-matrix $\A$, then the following property is verified:
\begin{equation}
\text{If }  \ssrhs \geq 0, \text{  then  }  \x \geq 0 \eqp
\end{equation}
Thus proving positivity-preservation, given the linear system matrix is an
M-matrix, is achieved by proving positivity of the right-hand-side vector $\ssrhs$.
This monotonicity property of the linear system matrix is also responsible for
the lack of spurious oscillations.

In this section, a first-order viscosity method introduced by Guermond
\cite{guermond_firstorder} will be adapted to the transport equation given by
Equation \eqref{eq:scalar_model}. This method uses an element-wise artificial
viscosity definition in conjunction with a graph-theoretic local viscous
bilinear form that makes the method valid for arbitrary element shapes and
dimensions. These definitions will be shown to ensure that the system matrix
is a non-singular M-matrix.

The graph-theoretic local viscous bilinear form has the following definition.
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{defn}[Local Viscous Bilinear Form]
   The local viscous bilinear form for element $K$ is defined as follows:
   \begin{equation}\label{eq:bilinearform}
     d_K(\test_j,\test_i) \equiv \left\{\begin{array}{l l}
       -\frac{1}{n_K - 1}V_K & i\ne j\eqc \quad i,j\in \indices_K\eqc \\
       V_K                   & i = j \eqc \quad i,j\in \indices_K\eqc \\
       0                     & \mbox{otherwise}\eqc
     \end{array}\right.
   \end{equation}
   where $V_K$ is the volume of cell $K$, $\indices_K$ is the set of degree
   of freedom indices such that the corresponding test function has support
   on cell $K$, and $n_K$ is the number of indices in that set.
\end{defn}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This bilinear form bears resemblance to a standard Laplacian bilinear form:
the diagonal entries are positive, the off-diagonal entries are negative, and
the row sums are zero. These facts will be invoked in the proof of the M-matrix
conditions later in this section.

The element-wise low-order viscosity definition from \cite{guermond_firstorder} is
adapted to account for the reaction term in the transport equation, 
Equation \eqref{eq:scalar_model}, but otherwise remains unchanged.
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{defn}[Low-Order Viscosity]
  The low-order viscosity for cell $K$ is defined as follows:
  \begin{equation}
    \nu^L_K \equiv \max\limits_{i\ne j\in\indices_K}
      \frac{\max(0,A_{i,j})}
      {-\sum\limits_{T\in \mathcal{K}(S_{i,j})}d_T(\test_j,\test_i)}
      \eqc
  \end{equation}
  where $A_{i,j}$ is the $i,j$ entry of matrix $\A$ 
  given by Equation \eqref{eq:Aij}, $\indices_K$ is the set of degree of freedom
  indices corresponding to basis functions that have support on cell $K$
  (this is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:cell_indices} -- the indicated
  nodes have degree of freedom indices belonging to $\indices_K$), and
  $\mathcal{K}(S_{i,j})$ is the set of cell indices for which the cell
  domain and the shared support $S_{i,j}$ overlap.
\end{defn}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This viscosity definition is designed to give the minimum amount of artificial
diffusion without violating the M-matrix conditions.

Now that the low-order artificial diffusion operator (bilinear form + viscosity definitions) 
has been provided, we describe the low-order system.
Consider a modification of the Galerkin scheme given in Equation \eqref{eq:galerkin_semidiscrete}
which lumps the mass matrix ($\M^C \rightarrow \M^L$) and adds an artificial
diffusion operator $\D^L$, hereafter called the low-order diffusion matrix:
\begin{equation}
  \M^L\ddt{\U^L} + (\A + \D^L)\U(t) = \ssrhs(t) \eqc
\end{equation}
where $\U^L(t)$ denotes the discrete low-order solution values.
Defining the low-order steady-state system matrix $\A^L\equiv\A + \D^L$,
the low-order system for the steady-state system, explicit Euler system,
and Theta system, respectively, are
\begin{subequations}
Steady-state:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:low_ss}
  \A^L \U = \ssrhs \eqc
\end{equation}
Explicit Euler:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:low_fe}
%  \M^L\frac{\U^{n+1} - \U^n}{\dt} + \A^L\U^n = \ssrhs^n \eqc
   \M^L \U^{n+1} = \M^L \U^n + \dt \pr{ \ssrhs^n - \A^L\U^n } \eqc
\end{equation}
Theta scheme:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:low_theta}
  \pr{ \M^L +\theta \dt \A^L} U^{n+1}
    = \M^L \U^n  + \dt( \ssrhs^\theta  - \A^L (1-\theta)\U^n )\eqc
%  \M^L\frac{\U^{n+1} - \U^n}{\dt} + \A^L\pr{\theta\U^{n+1} + (1-\theta)\U^n}
%    = \ssrhs^\theta \eqc
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
where $\ssrhs^\theta \equiv (1-\theta)\ssrhs^n + \theta\ssrhs^{n+1}$.
The low-order
diffusion matrix is assembled element-wise using the local viscous bilinear
form and low-order viscosity definitions:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:low_order_diffusion_matrix}
  D_{i,j}^L \equiv
    \sum\limits_{K\in \mathcal{K}(S_{i,j})}\nu^L_K
    d_K(\test_j,\test_i) \eqp
\end{equation}

Now the low-order scheme has been fully described, some statements will be
made on its properties. Firstly the M-matrix property will be shown for the low-order
matrix $\A^L$.
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{thm}[M-matrix property]
  The low-order steady-state system matrix $\A^L$ is a non-singular M-matrix.
\end{thm}
\input{content/m_matrix}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thus far, we have been proven that the system matrix for the low-order steady-state
system is an M-matrix, and it remains to demonstrate the same for each of the
transient systems. For the explicit Euler/SSPRK systems, the system matrix
is just the lumped mass matrix $\M^L$, which is easily shown to be an M-matrix
since it is a positive, diagonal matrix. For the $\theta$ temporal
discretization, the system matrix is a linear combination of the lumped mass
matrix and the low-order steady-state system matrix; this linear combination
is also an M-matrix since it is a combination of two M-matrices with non-negative
combination coefficients.

To complete the proof of positivity preservation for the low-order scheme, 
we need to show that
the system right-hand-side vectors for each temporal discretization are
non-negative.
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\input{content/positivity_preservation}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It can also be shown that the described low-order scheme satisfies a local
discrete maximum principle, which is easily shown given the M-matrix property.
One may decide to use these bounds as the imposed bounds in the FCT
algorithm; however, this approach has been found to yield less accurate solutions
than the approach to be outlined in Section \ref{sec:fct} and is thus not discussed here 
for brevity.
