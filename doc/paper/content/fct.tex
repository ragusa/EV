\subsubsection{The FCT System}

The entropy viscosity method described in Section \ref{sec:high} enforces
the entropy condition and thus produces numerical approximations that
converge to the entropy solution. However, numerical solutions may still
contain spurious oscillations and negativities, although these effects are
smaller in magnitude than for the corresponding Galerkin solution.
In this paper, the flux-corrected transport (FCT) algorithm
is used to further mitigate the formation of spurious oscillations and
to guarantee the absence of negativities.

The first ingredient of the FCT algorithm is the definition of the antidiffusive
fluxes. To arrive at this definition, the low-order systems, given by Equations
\eqref{eq:low_ss}, \eqref{eq:low_fe}, and \eqref{eq:low_theta} for each temporal
discretization, are augmented with the addition of the \emph{antidiffusion source}
$\p$, which now, instead of producing the low-order solution, produces the high-order
solution $\mathbf{U}^H$.
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:antidiffusionsource_ss}
  \A^L \U^H = \ssrhs + \p \eqc
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:antidiffusionsource_fe}
  \M^L\frac{\U^H - \U^n}{\dt} + \A^L\U^n = \ssrhs^n + \p^n \eqc
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:antidiffusionsource_theta}
  \M^L\frac{\U^H - \U^n}{\dt} + \A^L\pr{\theta\U^{n+1} + (1-\theta)\U^n}
    = \ssrhs^\theta + \p^\theta \eqp
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
Then the corresponding high-order systems, given by Equations \eqref{eq:high_ss},
\eqref{eq:high_fe}, \eqref{eq:high_theta} are subtracted from these equations
to give the following definitions for $\p$:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:antidiffusionsourcei_ss}
  \p \equiv \pr{\D^L - \D^H}\U^H \eqc
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:antidiffusionsourcei_fe}
  \p^n \equiv -\pr{\M^C - \M^L}\frac{\U^H - \U^n}{\dt} + \pr{\D^L - \D^H}\U^n \eqc
\end{equation}
\begin{multline}\label{eq:antidiffusionsourcei_theta}
  \p^\theta \equiv -\pr{\M^C - \M^L}\frac{\U^H - \U^n}{\dt}
    + (1-\theta)\pr{\D^L - \D^{H,n}}\U^n\\
    + \theta    \pr{\D^L - \D^{H,n+1}}\U^{n+1} \eqc
\end{multline}
\end{subequations}
The next step is to decompose each antidiffusive source $p_i$ into a sum of
antidiffusive fluxes: $p_i = \sum_j P_{i,j}$. Because the matrices $\M^C-\M^L$
and $\D^L-\D^H$ are symmetric and feature row sums of zero, the following
are valid antidiffusive flux decompositions:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
  P_{i,j} = \pr{D^L_{i,j} - D^H_{i,j}}\pr{U^H_j - U^H_i} \eqc
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  P^n_{i,j} = -M^C_{i,j}\pr{\frac{U^H_j - U^n_j}{\dt} - \frac{U^H_i - U^n_i}{\dt}}
    + \pr{D^L_{i,j} - D^{H,n}_{i,j}}\pr{U^n_j - U^n_i}  \eqc
\end{equation}
\begin{multline}
  P^{\theta}_{i,j} = -M^C_{i,j}\pr{\frac{U^H_j - U^n_j}{\dt} - \frac{U^H_i - U^n_i}{\dt}}
    + (1-\theta)\pr{D^L_{i,j} - D^{H,n}_{i,j}}\pr{U^n_j - U^n_i}\\
    + \theta\pr{D^L_{i,j} - D^{H,n+1}_{i,j}}\pr{U^H_j - U^H_i} \eqp
\end{multline}
\end{subequations}
Note that this decomposition yields equal and opposite antidiffusive flux pairs
since the antidiffusion matrix $\P$ is skew symmetric: $P_{j,i}=-P_{i,j}$
(and likewise for $P_{j,i}^n$ and $P_{j,i}^\theta$).
Up until this point, no changes have been made to the
high-order scheme: solving Equations \eqref{eq:antidiffusionsource_ss} through
\eqref{eq:antidiffusionsource_theta} still produces the high-order solution.
FCT is applied to these equations by applying limiting coefficients $L_{i,j}$ to
each antidiffusive flux $P_{i,j}$. Thus the FCT systems are the following:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fct_ss}
  \A^L \U^H = \ssrhs + \hat{\p} \eqc
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fct_fe}
  \M^L\frac{\U^H - \U^n}{\dt} + \A^L\U^n = \ssrhs^n + \hat{\p}^n \eqc
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fct_theta}
  \M^L\frac{\U^H - \U^n}{\dt} + \A^L\pr{\theta\U^{n+1} + (1-\theta)\U^n}
    = \ssrhs^\theta + \hat{\p}^\theta \eqc
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
where the hat denotes limitation: $\hat{p}_i\equiv\sum_j L_{i,j}P_{i,j}$.
The limiting coefficients range between zero and one, representing
full limitation and no limitation, respectively.
For example, setting all limiting
coefficients to zero would result in the low-order solution, and setting
all to one would result in the high-order solution. The actual values of the
limiting coefficients are determined by the limiter, which operates on the
following goal: maximize the limiting coefficients such that the imposed
solution bounds are not violated.

As will be discussed in Section \ref{sec:solution_bounds}, the solution bounds
for implicit FCT and steady-state FCT are implicit, and thus the systems given
by Equations \eqref{eq:fct_theta} and \eqref{eq:fct_ss} are nonlinear, since
the limiting coefficients contained in $\hat{\p}$ are nonlinear.
In this paper, a fixed-point iteration scheme is used to resolved the nonlinearities.
For any nonlinear iteration scheme, the
imposed solution bounds must be computed using the previous solution iterate:
\begin{equation}
  U_i^{-,(\ell)} \leq U_i^{(\ell+1)} \leq U_i^{+,(\ell)} \eqp
\end{equation}
Though the solution bounds are lagged, the antidiffusion bounds $\hat{p}_i^\pm$
still contains terms at iteration $\ell+1$; these terms must be lagged as well.
As a consequence, the solution bounds for implicit/steady-state
FCT schemes are only satisfied upon nonlinear convergence, not at each iteration.

\subsubsection{Antidiffusion Bounds}

Bounds imposed on a solution value $i$, such as the bounds described in Section
\ref{sec:solution_bounds}, directly translate into bounds on the limited
antidiffusion source $\hat{p}_i$. These antidiffusion bounds $\hat{p}_i^\pm$ for steady-state,
explicit Euler, and Theta discretization are respectively derived by
solving Equations \eqref{eq:fct_ss}, \eqref{eq:fct_fe}, and \eqref{eq:fct_theta}
for $\hat{p}_i$ and manipulating the inequality $U^-_i\leq U_i\leq U^+_i$. This yields:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:antidiffusion_bounds_ss}
  \hat{p}_i^\pm \equiv A_{i,i}^L U_i^\pm
    + \sumjnoti A_{i,j}^L U_j - b_i \eqc
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:antidiffusion_bounds_fe}
  \hat{p}_i^\pm \equiv M^L_{i,i}
    \frac{U_i^\pm - U_i^n}{\dt}
  + \sumj A_{i,j}^L U_j^n
  - b_i^n \eqc
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:antidiffusion_bounds_theta}
  \hat{p}_i^\pm \equiv
   \pr{\frac{M^L_{i,i}}{\dt}+\theta A_{i,i}^L}
     U_i^\pm
    + \pr{(1-\theta) A_{i,i}^L-\frac{M^L_{i,i}}{\dt}}
     U_i^n
  +\sumjnoti A_{i,j}^L U_j^\theta
  -b_i^\theta
  \eqp
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
We note that, if the limiting coefficients $L_{i,j}$ are selected such that
$\hat{p}_i^-\leq \hat{p}_i\leq \hat{p}_i^+$, then the solution bounds are
satisfied: $U^-_i\leq U_i\leq U^+_i$.

Limiters such as the Zalesak's limiter described in Section \ref{sec:limiter} are algebraic
operator, taking as input the antidiffusion bounds
$\hat{p}_i^\pm$ and the antidiffusive fluxes $P_{i,j}$ and returning as output the
limiting coefficients $L_{i,j}$. It is important to note that most limiters,
including the limiter described in this paper, assume the following:
$\hat{p}_i^-\leq 0$, $\hat{p}_i^+\geq 0$; the reasoning for this assumption
is as follows. Recall that FCT starts from the
low-order scheme, which is equivalent to the solution with $\hat{p}_i=0$.
The limiter should start from this point so that there is a fail-safe solution
for the FCT algoritm: the low-order solution. Otherwise, there is no guarantee
that any combination of values of limiting coefficients will achieve
the desired condition $\hat{p}_i^-\leq \hat{p}_i\leq \hat{p}_i^+$. If
$\hat{p}_i^- > 0$ or $\hat{p}_i^+ < 0$, then the starting state, the low-order
solution, with $\hat{p}_i=0$ is an invalid solution of the FCT algorithm.
Some solution bounds automatically satisfy $\hat{p}_i^-\leq 0$ and $\hat{p}_i^+\geq 0$,
but in general these conditions must be enforced. In this paper, the solution
bounds are possibly widened by directly enforcing these assumptions:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{p}_i^- \gets \min(0,\hat{p}_i^-) \eqc
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \hat{p}_i^+ \gets \max(0,\hat{p}_i^+) \eqp
\end{equation}
Omission of this step can lead to poor results: the assumptions of the
limiter are violated, and thus limiting coefficients that do not satisfy the
imposed solution bounds can be generated. Without this step, even negative limiting coefficients
may be generated, and this is especially consequential in implicit FCT
simulations, since the limiting coefficients are then essentially unbounded
toward $-\infty$; iteration can lead to extremely non-physical solutions
and severe convergence difficulties or failure. \tcr{does the last sentence refer to the case when this step is omitted or not?}
