\begin{itemize}
  \item smooth MMS problem - second-order convergence (based on length, could be a summary at the beginning of the results section + appendix)
  \item 1-D, 2-D void-to-absorber (normally-incident)
  \item 2-D obstruction test problem
  \item 1-D source-in-void test problem
  \item 1-D interface or three-region test problem
\end{itemize}
