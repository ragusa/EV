Entropy viscosity, in conjunction with flux-corrected transport (FCT), is applied to a
$\mathbb{P}_1$ continuous finite element (CFEM) discretization of the time-dependent
transport equation to produce a positivity-preserving scheme that satisfies
a local discrete maximum principle. Fully explicit time discretizations are
employed, including
explicit Euler and strong-stability-preserving Runge-Kutta (SSPRK) schemes
such as the 3-stage, 3rd-order-accurate Shu-Osher scheme (SSPRK33).
These explicit time discretizations require that a CFL condition be
satisfied, making many practical simulations prohibitively expensive; however,
this research is intended to be extended to implicit time discretizations
and steady-state simulations, where CFL conditions do not apply.
Results are presented for 1-D test problems.
