The figure below shows the convergence results for the void
problem, which because the solution is discontinuous, the theoretical
convergence rates for the high-order scheme are $\frac{3}{4}$ and $\frac{3}{8}$
for L-1 and L-2 error, respectively. The FCT scheme is shown here to
achieve these convergence rates.
