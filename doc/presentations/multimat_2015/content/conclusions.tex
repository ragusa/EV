The numerical solutions \underline{\bf using FCT for radiation transport} exhibit the following properties. 

Solutions 
\begin{itemize}
  \item are guaranteed non-negative
  \item are not guaranteed to be monotone, but rarely not monotone in practice
  \item satisfy a discrete maximum principle
  \item are 2nd-order accurate
\end{itemize}

Current and future work includes
\begin{itemize}
  \item \underline{\bf FCT for radiation transport implicit time discretizations}
  \item conservation law \emph{systems} (e.g., shallow water)
\end{itemize}
