\begin{itemize}
  \item Consider a linear conservation law model
    ($\consflux(\scalarsolution)=\velocity\scalarsolution$):
    \begin{equation}
      \pd{\scalarsolution}{t} + \nabla\cdot(\velocity\scalarsolution)
      + \reactioncoef(\x)\scalarsolution\xt = \scalarsource\xt \eqc
    \end{equation}
    where $\reactioncoef(\x)\ge 0$ and $\scalarsource\xt\ge 0$.
  \item Provide initial conditions and some boundary
    condition, such as Dirichlet:
   \begin{equation}
      u(\x,0) = u^0(\x) \quad \forall \x\in \domain
   \end{equation}
   \begin{equation}
      u\xt = u^{\text{inc}}(\x) \quad \forall \x\in \incomingdomainboundary
   \end{equation}
   \item CFEM solution:
   \begin{equation}
      \approximatescalarsolution\xt = \sum\limits_{j=1}^N U_j(t) \testfunction_j(\x) \eqc
      \quad \testfunction_j(\x)\in P^1_h

\frametitle{Boundary Conditions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The following 3 methods for imposing incoming flux boundary conditions
    for node $i$ are considered:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \hlorange{Strongly impose}: \emph{replace} equation $i$ with the equation
        $U_i = u^{\textup{inc}}(\x_i)$.
      \item \hlorange{Weakly impose}: evaluate incoming boundary fluxes 
        in equation $i$ with values $u^{\textup{inc}}(\x_j)$ instead of values $U_j$.
      \item Weakly impose with \hlorange{boundary penalty}: \emph{add} to
        equation $i$ a multiple $\alpha_i$ of the equation $U_i = u^{\textup{inc}}(\x_i)$,
        where $\alpha_i$ should be large enough such that this \emph{penalty}
        equation dominates the original equation $i$.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item The choice of incoming flux boundary condition will later to
    be shown to have consequences on conservation for FCT.
