\begin{itemize}
  \item A general system of conservation laws, with sources, is
    \begin{equation}
      \pd{\vectorsolution}{t} + \divergence\consfluxvector(\vectorsolution)
        = \conssource(\vectorsolution) \eqp
    \end{equation}
  \item After doing the following:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Substituting the approximate solution
        $\approximatevectorsolution\xt =
          \sum_j \solutionvector_j(t) \testfunction_j(\x)$,
          where $\solutionvector_j(t)$ are vector-valued degrees of freedom,
      \item Interpolating the flux function at the nodes,
        $\consfluxvector(\approximatevectorsolution)\rightarrow
          \sum_j\consfluxinterpolant_j(t)\testfunction_j(\x)$,
      \item Testing with $\testfunction_i(\x)$, and
      \item Evaluating with forward Euler (FE),
    \end{itemize}
    the discrete system becomes
    \begin{equation}
      \sum_j\consistentmassentry
        \frac{\solutionvector_j^{n+1}-\solutionvector_j^n}{\dt}
        + \sum_j\gradiententry\cdot\consfluxinterpolant_j^n
        = \ssrhs_i^n \eqc
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
      \gradiententry \equiv \int_{\support\ij}
        \testfunction_i(\x)\nabla\testfunction_j(\x) d\volume \eqc
      \quad
      \ssrhs_i(t) \equiv \int_{\support_i}
        \testfunction_i(\x)\conssource(\approximatevectorsolution)d\volume \eqp
    \end{equation}
\end{itemize}
