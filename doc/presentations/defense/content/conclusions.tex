\frametitle{Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Both the scalar and systems FCT schemes developed are
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Non-negativity-preserving
      \item Not guaranteed monotone, but work well in practice
      \item Entropy-inequality-enforcing
      \item 2nd-order-accurate for smooth problems
      \item Valid for unstructured meshes
    \end{itemize}
  \item The scalar scheme additionally satisfies a discrete maximum principle
  \item \emph{Stair-stepping}, or \emph{terracing} is observed in some
    FCT solutions, particularly when using FE
  \item Severe nonlinear convergence difficulties have been observed for
    implicit and steady-state FCT
  \item Characteristic limiting for 1-D SWE was shown to have some
    success but showed some terracing behavior
  \item No extension of FCT to 2-D SWE has been developed
  \item Invariant domain method has not yet been extended to non-flat
    bottom topography
\end{itemize}
