\begin{itemize}
  \item \hlorange{Implicit} and \hlorange{steady-state} time discretizations
    have \hlorange{nonlinear} EV and FCT schemes.
  \item A \hlorange{fixed-point} iteration scheme is used.
  \item The entropy viscosity scheme for implicit methods must iterate on
    the nonlinear entropy viscosities in the high-order diffusion matrix:
  \begin{equation}
    (\ssmatrix + \diffusionmatrix^{H,(\ell)})\solutionvector^{(\ell+1)}
      = \ssrhs \eqc
  \end{equation}
  \item The FCT scheme for implicit methods must iterate on the nonlinear
    limiting coefficients:
  \begin{subequations}
  \begin{equation}
    (\ssmatrix + \diffusionmatrix^L)\solutionvector^{(\ell+1)}
      = \ssrhs + \bar{\correctionfluxvector}^{(\ell)} \eqc
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
    \bar{\correctionfluxletter}_i^{(\ell)} = \sumj L\ij^{(\ell)} \correctionfluxij \eqc
  \end{equation}
  \end{subequations}
  where $L\ij^{(\ell)}$ depends nonlinearly on $Q_i^{\pm,(\ell)}$, which depends
  on $W_i^{\pm,(\ell)}$.
