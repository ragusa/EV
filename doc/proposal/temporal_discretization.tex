The remainder of this proposal assumes that forward Euler (FE) is used for the
temporal discretization. The methodology presented in this research is best
understood using FE; however, a class of explicit temporal discretizations
called Strong-Stability-Preserving Runge-Kutta (SSPRK) methods are expressible
as a combination of FE steps, so the methods given in this research are
applicable to higher-order temporal discretizations.
Implicit temporal discretizations such as $\theta$ methods like backward
Euler and Crank-Nicolson are also an option; however, in these cases, the
imposed bounds are implicit as well, so nonlinear solves are required.

The FE discretization for a general system $\mathbf{M}d\solutionvector/dt=
\mathbf{r}(\solutionvector(t),t)$ is the following:
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{M}\frac{\solutionvector^{n+1}-\solutionvector^n}{\dt} =
    \mathbf{r}(\solutionvector^n,t^n) \eqc
\end{equation}
where $\dt$ is the time step size.
