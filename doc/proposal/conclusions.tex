These are my conclusions.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Positivity-preserving
      \item Discrete-maximum-principle preserving
      \item Not guaranteed monotone, but works well in practice
      \item Entropy-inequality-enforcing
      \item 2nd-order-accurate for smooth problems
      \item Valid in multiple dimensions
      \item Valid for unstructured meshes
    \end{itemize}
