Solving conservation law problems with entropy viscosity and FCT

To run:
=================================================================================
1. edit TARGET in CMakeLists.txt to correspond to the conservation law
   for which you wish to run, e.g., "burgers" or "euler".

2. run cmake:

   cmake -DDEAL_II_DIR=~/bin/deal.II .

   Replace ~/bin/deal.II with the appropriate path if deal.II is not installed
   there.

3. run make:

   make

4. edit the input file corresponding to the conservation law for which you
   wish to run, e.g., "input_burgers" or "input_euler".

5. run the executable created by make, e.g., "burgers" or "euler".


To plot 1-D results:
