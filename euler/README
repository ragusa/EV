Solving conservation law problems with entropy viscosity and FCT

=================================================================================
To run:
=================================================================================
1. Edit TARGET in CMakeLists.txt to correspond to the conservation law
   for which you wish to run, e.g., "burgers" or "euler".

2. Run cmake:

   $ cmake -DDEAL_II_DIR=~/bin/deal.II .

   Replace ~/bin/deal.II with the appropriate path if deal.II is not installed
   there.

3. Run make:

   $ make

4. Edit the input file corresponding to the conservation law for which you
   wish to run, e.g., "input_burgers" or "input_euler".

5. Run the executable created by make, e.g., "burgers" or "euler".


=================================================================================
To plot 1-D results:
=================================================================================
Run the script "plot":

$ plot

This script calls the script "plot_explicit" with arguments inferred by the
contents of CMakeLists.txt and the appropriate input file. To call
"plot_explicit" directly, call it without arguments to see the correct usage.

=================================================================================
To compile and view doxygen:
=================================================================================
1. Compile the html output:

   $ doxygen Doxyfile

2. Open the file ./html/index.html in your favorite browser.

The script "dox" executes the above and switches focus to the web browser.
It assumes that Google Chrome and "wmctrl" are installed:

$ dox
